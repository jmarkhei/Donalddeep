       "\" thank you very much, everybody. thank you. thank you. great honor. please, thank you. sit down, please. its great to be with you. great company and wonderful location. quick flight. its in and out, but we have some big things to say. carol, i want to thank you also for doing such an incredible job at this company. i look at your numbers and im very jealous. a lot of people are very jealous. but im delighted to be back in atlanta, georgia, special place. the hometown of one of the most amazing companies on earth, ups. they never fail. the dedicated men and women of ups are an inspiration to us all. in the face of every challenge, you always come through for your fellow citizens. would you say thats correct? i say its correct.    let me start by expressing my gratitude to every driver, worker, and employee who has contributed to this great success and continue to deliver for america throughout our battle against the china virus, it goes by many different names, about 21 that i can figure. we maybe well use a different one every time we hit it, but whatever it is, it was a terrible thing and it could have been stopped and it should have been stopped right where it started in china. together, we will defeat this virus and emerge stronger than ever before. were here today to celebrate a historic breakthrough that will transform the lives of workers and families all across our nation.    for decades, the single biggest obstacle to building a modern transportation system has been the mountains and mountains of bureaucratic red tape in washington, dc. before i took off, its reviews for highways ballooned to an average of nearly 750 pages in length, and they were the good ones, they were the short ones. and i know because i was in business for a long time and i had to go through a process that was so ridiculous. it was so ridiculous. we went through a process for building buildings usually, it would take forever. by the time you start building, the market changed. you said, the market was good when we started, now the markets lousy. so youd say, to hell with it. we wont build.    sometimes youd start building and youd say, that was a mistake. but we went through years and years of litigation and tumult, and it was just not good, but youd go through it. to an even greater extent, the maze like approval process represented lobbyists that were very rich. they were making a lot of money. i remember id go up to albany, new york and id see my lobbyists up there. id say, what are you doing here? i knew what they were doing. they were trying to make it more difficult so you had to hire them for more and more work, spend millions and millions of dollars for nothing. but too often, they caused massive delays on top of everything else. and that way they got their fees over a longer period of time.    its one of the reasons why, for example, the average atlanta driver spends an incredible 77 hours in traffic during a short period of time. but all of that ends today. were doing something very dramatic. we just completed an unprecedented, i dont want to say its absolutely unprecedented, top to bottom overhaul should have been done years ago of the infrastructure approval process. this approval process that has cost trillions of dollars over the years for our country and delays like you wouldnt believe. this is a truly historic breakthrough, which means better roads, bridges, tunnels, and highways for every ups driver and every citizen all across our land.    together were reclaiming americas proud heritage as a nation of builders and a nation that can get things done. because with these horrible roadblocks that were put in front of us, you couldnt get it done. no matter how good you were, you couldnt get it done. youd wait and wait. youd go to the next step. you say you cant start the next step until you finish the first. joining us for this special occasion are council of environmental quality chairman, mary neumayr. wheres mary? mary. thank you, mary. thank you. thank you. thank you, mary. good. secretary of transportation, a very special woman, a great woman, somebody that has done an incredible job, elaine chao. elaine.    and she was very much instrumental in getting this done. and when elaine speaks, we all listen, but she was very much instrumental. secretary of agriculture, a man who has done a fantastic job for our farmers and ranchers, sonny perdue. sonny. i learned more about farming from sonny purdue than all of these consultants that came in. i learned more in a half an hour from that man right there. we had a great call today with the farmers too. great call. theyre doing very well. a lot of good things have happened, right sonny? a lot of things have happened. they were targeted by china. they were targeted by others. we just signed the usmca, which is phenomenal for our country and our farmers. got rid of one of the worst trade deals in history, nafta.    one of the worst trade deals ever, how anybody could have signed it, but worse, how anybody could have let it run for 25 years or whatever it was. they just took advantage of us. we had 60,000 empty plants and factories in our country by the time that mess got finished. so we just signed a great deal, usmca. its the largest trade deal ever made, mexico, canada, the largest ever made. i know sonny would like me to thank the ups, all of the drivers and workers for all of the help in delivering nearly 30 million meals to rural children throughout the country for our meals-to-you program. meals-to-you, you know what that is? meals-to-you. you do, right?    were also pleased to be joined by a great senator, somebody thats done a phenomenal job. and i can tell you, look, hes a friend of mine, so im a little prejudiced, but hes a man thats respected by everybody on both sides of the us senate. he works hard. he loves your state. and i always say, does david get the kind of recognition that he deserves? because he is a very, very special man. david perdue, where is david? david, thank you. and a woman whos come in and done a great job. and shes been so supportive of me and the agenda, and a good person, a good woman with her husband whos a terrific man, senator kelly loeffler. thank you very much. thank you, kelly. great job, kelly.    and warriors, these are warriors. these people fought for us through thick and thin, through very, very unfair territory. we were treated terribly and they came in and they turned out to be tougher than the other side by a lot. and i just want to introduce representatives rick allen, rick. thanks, rick. the great buddy carter. buddy. an incredible spokesman, an incredible man and friend, doug collins. doug. thank you, doug. great job, doug. drew ferguson. drew. thank you very much, drew. jody hice. jody. thank you, jody. great job, jody. and barry loudermilk. barry, thank you very much. and also two people, friends of mine. theyll be there soon in my opinion because they have to, because we need all the help we can get in washington.    karen handel. karen, thank you very much. thank you, karen. and rich mccormick. rich, thank you. theyll be there soon i hope. i hope. we need them. we need them. get them in there. thank you as well to a man who i became very good friends with, a man who was running against somebody that was unbeatable, running against a superstar. i said, oh, shes a superstar. wow. can you beat superstars? i dont think so, but he figured out how to be a superstar. and i dont know if shes still a superstar, brian. im not sure. im not sure. i dont think so. i dont know. superstars dont lose. do they? governor brian kemp. ill tell you, what a warrior he is. hes tough. hes tough and hes done a great job.    youve done a great job in every aspect of running this incredible state. and ive always been there for you. he was saying when we met at the plane, everything weve needed in georgia, youve been there for, and thats right. thats right. perhaps more important than brian, however, right? far more important is georgia first lady, marty kemp. thank you very much, marty. and watch please those mail-in ballots. youre going to watch that for me because they have a lot of problems all over the country. they just had paterson, new jersey where massive percentages of the vote was a fraud. mail-in ballots, be careful. be careful. they would understand because they deliver.    in fact, im going to have to be very nice to ups. ups, i love you, carol, wherever you are, carol. i love you, carol. now its very bad whats going on with mail-in ballots. okay? as differentiated from absentee ballots where you have to go and you go through a process because you cant be there for some reason, but the mail-in ballots is going to be, theyre going to be rigged. theyre going to be a terrible situation. and you have to be careful in georgia, but you have to be careful everywhere where theyre doing it. we went through a first world war and a second world war and people went to vote. now theyre saying, lets use this-    or people went to vote. now theyre saying lets use this as a chance not to vote. and theres been tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption on mail-in ballots. so absentee ballot, great, mail-in ballot, absolutely no good. it makes no sense. a governor sends out millions of ballots all over the place. they dont know where theyre going. theyre going to wherever. i have a friend who got one for his daughter, another one for his daughter, and then a second one for the first daughter. they didnt know what to do with them. i had another friend, a really wonderful guy who lost his son seven years ago, robert, his son, robert, and his son was sent a mail-in ballot. he called me, he said, what do i do? i just got a mail-in ballot for robert? robert died seven years ago. so its a terrible situation if they decide to use it. and well see what happens. theres a lot of litigation, a lot of court cases right now.    and it makes sense. just think of it. millions of ballots. in california, theyre sending out millions of ballots. they dont even know who. maybe they know too well who theyre sending them to. and maybe its the people that dont get it. maybe its an area of republicans or democrats that dont happen to get any ballots. weve had a lot of problems. just take a look at whats gone on over the last month and take a look at patterson, new jersey. small city in new jersey. i think they said something like 20% of the ballots were corrupted or something happened with them. 20%. and even in the 2016 election, 1% are in question. but i dont want to talk about that one because i won. so i dont want anyone going back and looking, all right? im not going to talk about 2016. that was the greatest election.    and now we have to do something very important. we have to keep it going or this country will be in big, big trouble. i want to thank also for being here, georgia attorney general, chris carr. youre the one chris. watch that chris, will you? williams. youre going to watch that, chris, please, okay? you got to speak to the man that handles it. you know what im talking about. you got to do it. thank you, chris. its in good hands. superintendent richard woods. richard, thank you very much. thank you. and members of the georgia public service commission and the state senate and house transportation committee. weve got a lot of politicians in this room. and really good luck to karen and to rich. go out and go get them. youre great people. todays action is part of my administrations fierce commitment to slashing the web of needless bureaucracy that is holding back our citizens. ive been wanting to do this from day one. then we started on day one, literally on day one, but it takes a long time. you have statutory requirements. you have a lot of different roadblocks, even to changing it. but the change youll be hearing about in a minute, and its one of the biggest things we can be doing for our country. the last administration increased the federal register by 16,000 pages of job-killing regulations. under my administration, we have cut the federal register by nearly 25,000 pages, more than any president in history, whether its four years, eight years or one case more.    and we, frankly, this i would think is maybe the biggest of all. we did the u.s. waters. you saw that? the u.s. waters act? that was a big one. that was a big one. i thought i was going to take a lot of heat when i did that, and instead, it was just the opposite. people came up, grown men that had never cried even when they were a baby, they were standing behind me when i signed that bill at the white house, and they were crying. they were crying because we gave their life back to them. that took their life away. it took their livelihood away. it was a big, big moment, but this is a big moment today, too. probably, possibly equally as big.    todays action completely modernizes the environmental review process under the national environmental policy act of 1969. we are cutting the federal permitting timeline from a staggering 10 years, 15 years, 18 years, 21 years. you know the story. youve seen it. projects that start out, a young guy heads the project. by the time it gets approved or disapproved, in many cases, disapproved, usually disapproved, hes getting ready to retire. say, what do you do for your life? i worked on one project. we didnt get it through in the end. now we wont get certain projects through for environmental reasons. they have to be environmentally sound, but you know what? were going to know in a year. were going to know in a year and a half. were not going to know in 20 years.    so were cutting the federal permitting timeline for a major project from up to 20 years or more, hard to believe, down to two years or less. so we have it down to about two years right now, elaine, and i think two years or less, and our goal is one year. and you may get disapproved. they may vote at the end. they didnt like something environmentally or safety-wise, and im all for that. but youre not going to devote a lifetime to doing a project that doesnt get approved or that gets approved. and oftentimes when it gets approved, it comes in at 10, 20, 30 times the cost.    theres a highway in a certain state, short road, not even a highway, i guess, more of a roadway. and they put it in, it was a straight line from point to point. by the time they finished it 18 years later, it was this. it cost tens of times, it cost many, many, many times more than the original. its a dangerous roadway because theres turns. you got to be in good shape. you got to be wide awake to make those turns. you got to see those things. you have to see the guard rails, boom. they had a simple straight roadway and now they build it and they end up... it took 17 years to get it approved. ended up costing many, many times what the original estimates were, and its no good. its not good.    under the last administration, a mere 7% of reviews for federal highways were processed within two years. now what were doing is, the two years wont be the exception, it will be the rule. so what were doing is were going to have that coming down at a much steeper rate. this will reduce approval times for highways alone by at least 70%. but the 70% is a very unambitious number because the numbers going to be actually much lower than that. at the heart of the reforms is the one federal decision policy. it really spells it out when you hear that name. one federal decision. before, applicants for infrastructure permits were forced to spend years and years navigating a labyrinth of federal agencies, and every single one had the power to stop a project.    anytime you went to an agency, they had a power to stop it. and it would stop the project. not only stop it, right in its tracks, it would stop it. with our reforms, it would be one quick and fair decision. were going to give every project a clear answer, yes or no. yes or no. the two-year process where just to submit is two years is not acceptable. its going to be a very quick yes or no after study, but the studies are going to go quickly, and theyre going to go simultaneously.    so if youre in numerous agencies, youre all going at the same time instead of waiting for one, for two, for three. and oftentimes youd go through one, it would take you six months, and then you have to wait 90 days, and then you have a review period, and then you start the second one. and now you go for another four months, and then you wait 90 days, and you have a review period. and sometimes you had to go through nine, 10, 12 different agencies. so even if you did absolute rapid, it was many, many years before you could even think about starting it.    we have up here, by the way, thats a chart of the old system and the new system. and i think the new system is better. i think its better not only in time. i think its better in terms of the process. and i think its better in terms of the importance from an environmental and a safety standpoint. but take a look at that. this is what you had to go through. in fact, it was much more dramatic when i first came up with this about a year ago. we took that and we rolled it out. it was so dramatic, and it just kept going and going. so the difference is that, and many of those steps you had to wait before you could even think about going to the next one, and you had to get full approvals. any one of those colors, where there was a problem or a rejection, meant it was dead. and now you go through this very simple but very comprehensive solution. thats a beautiful thing. especially if you understand construction and building and other things beyond building like i do.    at the same time, well maintain americas gold standard environmental protections. the united states will continue to have among the very cleanest air and cleanest water on earth, which we do now. we have the cleanest that weve ever had, ever meaning, i guess, in the last 40 years. i assume that 200 years ago was cleaner. i can imagine it was very clean a couple of hundred years ago, brian, right?    thats why im very careful with the fake news media, because if i say that, we have the cleanest water weve ever had, they said, what about 200 years ago before anybody touched the lake? when the lake was a beautiful virgin lake. nobody ever touched it. they said, yeah, they got me on that one, dont they, huh? so now ive become extremely careful. so i say probably theyre talking about 35, 40 years, something like that. if its any different from that, media, we will... look at all those people back there. any different than that, we will report to you. we will make an amendment. well never make a correction because i dont like doing that.    one of the first projects accelerated by these reforms will be the planned expansion of i-75 right here in georgia. thats in honor of your wife, in honor of marty. okay? thats in honor of marty. theyve been looking to do that for many years, right? but the governor is going to get it done. this expansion will add 77 new lane miles of commercial vehicles like those driven by ups, saving drivers countless hundreds of hours a year. with us today is julian [palk 00:22:03], a teamster, i know the teamsters very well, at ups who drives this route often. julian, please come up and tell your story, please. thank you.    thanks, julian.    fantastic job. thank you, julian. but julian, it looks like youre attributing a lot of your success to your wife. is that a correct statement?    would you please stand up? so lovely. thank you. thats great. great job. youre proud of the job he just did, i think. huh? pretty good. hell be running for office next week. watch. great job, julian. thank you. id like to invite ups vice president of corporate transportation, bill taylor, up to say a few words. please, bill.    thank you, bill. thank you very much.    thank you very much, bill and good luck. carol, i dont think id let him retire. hes got about 30 years left in him at ups. cant believe youre retiring. thats terrible. you want to retire or do you want to stay because theyll renew you for 25 years. youve got it. youve done a fantastic job. thank you very much. thank you, bill. really great job. here as well as the commissioner of georgia department of transportation, russell mcmurry. russell, please come up and say a few words. thank you.    and russell said that so well because there have been many steps that weve made over the course of the last three years that allowed us to get to this big, giant step. this is a big deal, and this is front page all over this country. frankly, nobody realizes what it means other than the people that are in this room and others that do what you do, but the fact is, this is something that nobody thought was possible. but it was all those little steps, russell, that allowed us to get to this step bureaucratically and then every other way. thank you very much and youve done a great job. appreciate it. were also joined by janell king, a small business owner here in atlanta. janell, please come up and say a few words, please.    thank you. thank you very much.    thank you very much. great job. great job. and look how proud your husband is of you. he had that camera up. that camera wasnt moving down, ill tell you. he captured every word...    camera up, that camera wasnt moving down, i tell you. he captured every word. thats great. beautiful family. thank you very much. one of the things ill tell you that the governor and i are working on, a couple of projects that are going to be big surprises for you, big ones, big projects that youve been talking about for 20 years i guess in one case. so well get them done. im sure well get them done. and i want to thank you all. great presentations. thank you all very much.    my administration is also moving full speed ahead on improving the port of savannah, which is now the largest agriculture exporting port in the entire united states, largest in the country. as many of you know, this project faced 20 years of unnecessary delays. this has been going on for years. when they came to me and the governor said, can you help us with this? i said, well help you with it. whats the story? its been going on for years and years. theyve been talking about it. nothing ever happened. it was also eight years of additional bureaucratic reviews, just reviews. this isnt like, oh, gee, lets start digging. this is paperwork. people made a lot of money. its a terrible thing. it just gets caught up like so many other places. but its all ending now.    bureaucratic reviews under the obama-biden administration have been a disaster. and they got worse. but im proud to report that for three straight years under my administration, weve delivered full funding for the port of savannah and were on track to complete the project in a very short period of time. its going to be complete. in honor of the governor. in honor of the governor and marty. good. congratulations. that was a great job. theyve been fighting for that one for a long time. you got it done. we want a governor that gets it done. even though he calls me all the time, can we get it done? i wish he wouldnt call so much. but you know, thats the sign of a good governor, right? when you think, right? stand up, please. thats a sign of a governor. i like the ones that dont call, brian, where they just leave me alone. but their project never happens. great job you do, great job.    we want the united states to compete and win in the 21st century. and that means we will not allow our nation to be hamstrung by wasteful washington regulations. were the nation that built the golden gate bridge in four years, the hoover dam in five years. and a lot of people dont understand this, but its so true, we built the empire state building and less than a year. can you imagine that? the biden administration, our past vice president, opposes, think of this, all of our permitting reforms, and wants to increase the length of the permitting process. think of this, this is in his bernie sanders deal. biden is happy to tie up projects in red tape, and we want to get things built. but they want to increase the length. so they want to increase it from that to much longer. unbelievable.    biden wants to massively re-regulate the energy economy, rejoin the paris climate accord, which would kill our energy totally. and youd have to close 25% of your businesses and kill oil and gas development. they still havent explained what theyre going to do to power our great plants and factories. but at some point, im sure they will. well learn that from aoc, whos in charge of energy. shes in charge, along with bernie. its aoc and bernie are in charge of energy. i dont think texas is too happy about that. what do you think? you think well call up the governor, governor abbott, great governor. well ask, how do you like that governor? i didnt want to waste the phone call because i would know how he felt.    and biden wants to hold hostage billions in federal surface transportation grants for states and localities, unless the states and local suburban communities abolish single family zoning rules. so they want low income housing to be built in communities that frankly, they dont want it. they dont want it. hasnt worked out. and were terminating that as you know. i announced it two weeks ago. were going to be eliminating that rule. its a crazy rule and its very unfair to a lot of people. a lot of people are very unhappy.    it should not take 10 years or more just to get approval for a simple stretch of road. special interests in washington will never begin, they will never begin to let you breathe. thats not their business. their business is the opposite. and we will do vetoes wherever necessary in order to make sure everything happens and happens quickly. were not giving a veto for one thing, americas future. there will never be a veto for americas future. so my goal, my mission, and my commitment to each of you is very simple. americas infrastructure will be the envy of the entire world as it was many, many years ago. we built the interstate highway system during the eisenhower administration, a long time ago. and since then its gotten worse and worse and worse and more bureaucratic and more bureaucratic. and now were freeing up and were going back probably to around 1952. were going back to a long time ago. and again, you do have to get permits. we want safety. we want to be totally involved with the environment. we want our environment to be better than it would be the other way, the long way. but youre going to get your answers quickly. one way or the other, youre going to get those answers very quickly. and if the answer is a big, beautiful, yes, youre going to start construction immediately. youre not going to wait around for 10, 12, and 20 years.    our bridges, tunnels, freeways, and airports will no longer be the site of shame, but theyll be a source of pride. from coast to coast, town to town, were constructing new roads, railways, runways, and waterways. you know, we had many cases where theyll get federal funding to build a highway, then itll take them forever to get the approval. and by the time they have it approved, they need 10 times more money. they come back to the federal government. and the government would usually turn them down. theyd say that wasnt the deal. but sometimes theyd just paid 10 times more. were not going to do that anymore.    were linking our cities with gleaming highways and blazing fast broadwalk. and if you think, when you look at the farmers of this country, what theyve gone through with the broadband, broadband is so bad in the middle section, that beautiful middle section of our country, our farmers, our ranches are hurt very badly. so were getting fast broadband networks, and were carving them out, and towering, beautiful new monuments to american greatness. and thats what they will be. but our farmers have to be thought of also. nobody thought of our farmers. our farmers are incredible and theyre doing an incredible job, doing an incredible job. so for the farmers out there, broadband, here we come. broadband, theyve been trying to get it for a long time, many years.    together, were building our incredible future with american hands, american heart, and american steel. as your president, im more determined than ever that americas infrastructure will be second to none. and in georgia, youre going to have an infrastructure and youre going to have some projects announced that almost all of the people in this room do not know about. most people have given up on them, brian. i think theyve given up, they gave up with the rest of them. but we have some things planned in georgia thatll be really incredible. and everybodys going to want it. both democrat, by the way, and republican. the problem is nobody was able to get it done. we get it done. one thing i know, i know how to get things done.    and under this administration, we will always put america first. we were putting other countries first. now were putting america first. so i want to thank everybody for being here. i want to thank and congratulate ups on having a great run, many years, but a great run recently. youve done a fantastic job, whether its sky bridge or anything else that weve done with you, youve been fantastic. i really appreciate it. but especially i appreciate a state called georgia. its a special place. its a great place. and its an honor to be with you. and its an honor, this is where im announcing, this is good for the whole country. not only georgia, this is for the whole country, but im announcing it in georgia because we have some great things planned for you. you are special people. mr. governor, thank you very much. marty, thank you very much. everybody, thank you. thank you everybody. thank you very much, everybody. have a good time.   thank you. thank you. thank you to vice president pence. hes a good guy. weve done a great job together. and merry christmas, michigan. thank you, michigan. what a victory we had in michigan. what a victory was that. one of the greats. was that the greatest evening? but im thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of christmas, the greatness of america and the glory of god. thank you very much.    and did you notice that everybody is saying merry christmas again? did you notice? saying merry christmas. i remember when i first started this beautiful trip, this beautiful journey, i just said to the first lady, you are so lucky. i took you on this fantastic journey. its so much fun. they want to impeach you. they want to do worse than that. by the way, by the way, by the way, it doesnt really feel like were being impeached. the country is doing better than ever before. we did nothing wrong. we did nothing wrong. and we have tremendous support in the republican party like weve never had before. nobodys ever had this kind of support.    but this sacred season, our country is thriving and its thriving truly like it has never, it has never happened before to the extent whats happening now. and by the way, your state, because of us, not because of local government, but because of us, because of the job that weve done. because i understand shes not fixing those potholes. thats what the word is. it was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you. we dont want to do that. but shes not fixing the potholes. but michigans had the best year its ever had. best year its ever had. and thats because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and theyre coming in from japan and theyre coming in from a lot of other places. look whats happening. and you know, i dont know if you know this, but probably 10 years ago i was honored. i was the man of the year by i think somebody, whoever. i was the man of the year in michigan. can you believe it? long time.    and that was long before i ever decided to do this. i was happy. i had a beautiful life. what the hell did i do this for? but look how were doing. do we love it? i love it. but anyway, i was the man of the year and probably close to 10 years ago and i came to michigan. he said, youre still the man of the year. thank you. who said that? thank you. so i came in and i remember the speech so well. i said, why are you allowing them to steal your car companies? why are you allowing them to go to mexico and to go from china where they come in from china, they build them in china, they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs, you lose your factories, the companies leave and you get nothing. why are they lying? i asked that a long time ago and we stopped it. weve stopped it. and you see that.    and we just made the usmca. were getting rid of nafta, which i think is the worst trade deal ever. and its very exciting. its a great deal. its a great deal. its going to stop exactly what we were just talking about. it makes it very, very prohibitive. they can do it, but theyve got to pay a hell of a big price to do it. and history has proven that stops them. but we have a great usmca that we negotiated with mexico, with canada. now, from the standpoint of the farmers, you know whats going on. we had tremendous trade barriers in canada. we had attacks on dairy products, 297% tariff, nobody talked about it, with canada. and we had some really bad things with mexico. we now have a wonderful deal. and if we didnt have a good deal, you know what i would have done what? what? i would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it, right? that would have been it. unfortunately the deals been sitting with nancy pelosi for a long time and what happened? and she had a lot of pressure, especially from manufacturing areas, farm areas, a lot of pressure to sign it. so heres what happens. so i get along with labor. i had a lot of union labor vote for me, tremendous amount of labor. in new york where i come from, we have a lot of unions. and thats okay. thats fine. so we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed, well give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal. and now you have the democrats trying to take credit for this deal and thats okay. whatever it takes. for seven months, it sits. they dont do anything. we give. and by the way, i spoke to the unions the day before i say, fellows, you got to get it done. and union labor loves me and i love you too sir. i love you too sir. so we have a great deal with mexico, with canada. and it is true. i say it out loud because i say it to them right now. if they ever wanted to break the deal, thats okay. if somebody wants to break a deal with me, you always have to have an alternative, right? and this country, the deals we made, we did a deal with south korea. thats great. we did a deal with japan, 40 billion dollar deal with japan. it was just a little piece of a deal. okay? that was a piece of a deal. and i said to japan, look, you got to make this deal or were going to put a 20% tariff on the cars. and thats more money than anything were talking about.    thats all right. thats all right. thats all right. get her out.    ger her out of here.    oh well. youre about to hear the greatest speech youve ever heard. and thats going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot... massive riots. fake news. but seriously, look, look, look, they wont say it. they wont say it, because when we have protesters all in favor, they dont talk about it, but theres a slob. theres a real slob. wait, wait a minute. shell get hell when she gets back home with mom. but she made... look, she screams a little bit. and you know what i like to do? avoid them. because ill tell you the big problem. i could hardly hear her. what happens is all of you people go crazy. look, look, look, and the place.    okay, so theres one disgusting person who made... wait, wait, who made a... i wouldnt say this, but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right? now they wont say that, the fake news, they wont say it. if one of us did that, it would be like the biggest story ever. i think its terrible. and ill tell you the other thing, i dont know who the security company is, but the police came up, but they want to be so politically correct so they dont grab her wrist lightly and get her out. they say, oh, would you please come? would you please come with me? sure. maam, would you? and then she gives the guy the finger and he, oh, oh. you got to get a little bit stronger than that, folks.    i hate to see it. i hate to see it. but of course the guys afraid that hell grab her wrist lightly and hell be sued for the rest of his life, that youve destroyed her life. but i think its a terrible thing. and heres what happens though, these fakers back there, theyre the most dishonest people in the world. theyll go back. this is one person who made a horrible gesture only because the security man let her have so much time. and usually i have to say the police do an incredible job. they do [inaudible 00:12:10]. and they...    (silence). making another group of tariffs, seven and a half percent. this gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal, which they want to start, but were taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted, 16 billion and 12 billion the previous year, helps the farmers. so you know what we do, out of that big check that we get, all that money flows into the treasury. out of the big check, we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year.    and you know, the incredible thing, and i was with a lot of farmers. i was with a group of 36 farmers at the white house. you know what they said to me? i said, dont worry about it. were going to take care of you guys. and i used a bad word. you know what word i used? were going to get you a subsidy. and they said this two years ago, i said, how much were you targeted for? this was the first year. 12 billion, sir. the second year was 16. they were target. thats what they didnt get from china. so i said, its all right, were going to give you a subsidy of the same and were going to take it out of the tariffs and were going to have billions and billions of dollars left over. and they said, sir, we dont want money. we just want a level playing field. ive never seen that before. ive never seen that before.    its true. they just want to be able to have a level playing field. i could, because i sit at a lot of those meetings and whether its countries or whether its companies, everybody wants money. the farmers just wanted a level playing field. but we took good care of our farmers, that i can tell you. and we made the largest ever investment in our military. 738 billion dollars, all made in the usa. right? [inaudible 00:00:14:32].    so we will have invested in our military, since im here, which is less than three years. our military, by the way, in all due respect to the previous two administrations, our military was depleted. it was depleted. it was in bad shape. we had fighter jets that were 35 years old. we had planes that were 60 years... you heard where the father flew them, the grandfather flew them, and now the young son comes in. weve got the best equipment in the world now. spent two and a half trillion dollars, made in the usa. two and a half trillion. we will shortly. thatll be all finished. were going to have the greatest... now we have the best planes. were going to have the best ships. were building a lot of ships now. were building the most powerful weapons in the world. now, we dont want to even talk about it. we never want to use them. but you know, the way were not going to have to use them is if we have them.    were building submarines, the power of which nobodys ever seen before. nobodys ever seen before. its funny, we have these companies come in. i like to make good deals. you like to make good deals. thats what we do, right? so these really countries that come in, prime ministers, presidents, sometimes dictators, those we cant deal with too much. sir, wed like to buy a nuclear submarine. i say, no thanks. i turn them all down. you have no idea how many people... but were building some of the... theyre the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind. i say mankind and womankind.    see in the old days, in the old days, i would say mankind. now i say mankind, womankind. this way, i dont get in trouble with our friends. but we have the most powerful in the world and what were doing is incredible. what were doing with missiles, with rockets, with everything. and you know what, again, we dont want to ever have to use it, but we will never have anything like whats mostly been built. we have the f-35. its stealth. and i was at one of the areas where theyre displaying it and i went up to the pilots and honestly, theyre better looking than tom cruise. okay? good movie. good guy too, by the way. the face is equal, maybe slightly better. the bodys bigger and stronger. they can definitely... because like [inaudible 00:17:23]. they can definitely fight. theyre the real deal. these guys, so good looking. i said, you could be a movie star. go to hollywood. no sir. i like doing what im doing.    so i said to these guys, you going to see, just like central casting, i said, i said, fellas, how good is this plane? they said, sir, its great.    why?    because the enemy cant see it. that helps. stealth. its actually called super stealth. so i said, you mean they cant see, so you shoot at them but they cant... he said, they have no idea where we are, sir. i said, that sounds good to me. nobody does it. nobody can do it. we have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes, we bought in a lot of great stuff. and i wont tell you the story, but very early on i thought we were going to have a problem someplace, and one of the generals came up to me and said, sir, dont go. dont do it.    why?    we dont have the ammunition. and i said two things. i never want to hear a president. right? we never want to have a president hear that again, nor do we want a president to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then. but, another thing we did, which to me is such an incredible thing to have done. its such an honor. so our last us armed forces, the last branch was the air force, right? that was many, many decades ago. we are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the united states armed forces, the space force. so ill be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else, see that space force? that was my baby. and you think that was easy? thats not easy. because you have democrats that do not like our military. they do not like our military.    and we did something yesterday, because for three years i would see people that run... incredible people, the heads of the historically black colleges and universities in the country. and every year theyd come in and theyd be looking for help. they needed help and they do need help with it and its great and they do an incredible job. so many great schools, but they need help. and every year theyd have to come and come. i got to know them actually. i said, the only bad thing is you wont see me too much anymore. because we just provided record funding for a nations historically black colleges and universities. and its longterm, theyre not going to have to come. so i said, look, we could do it where we do it every year or well do what we have. what do you want? they said, let us just have it. so well miss them. but they are great people. theyve done an incredible job.    and our extraordinary jobs boom, which created another 266,000 jobs last month, and then you add the undercount from the previous two months, youre close to 300,000 jobs. and they said, if youre a business watcher which i am, i love watching business, but they said they were guessing, could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said. then the number comes out, 266,000 with an adjustment. remember about four months ago when we had one little period, right? we had one little period where there was a little downturn. they said, oh, oh, we think were going into a recession. i said, dont worry about it.    we think were going into a recession. they were willing to lose their wealth. they were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own, what do you guys own back there? let it go. theyll go bust. they dont care. anything to get rid of us. not me, us. and you know what? then all of a sudden, and now for the last couple of weeks, weve set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets. so, as of yesterday, weve had 133 record days in the stock market now, and thats in less than three years. so when i see that i dont care because i dont... im not allowed to have stock. i cant have stock. they consider it a conflict of interest and that i can understand. i agree. i can.    but you know what? ill tell you what. what i see, i see tremendous job growth because were setting records. but you know what i also see? the 401ks where people are up 90%, theyre up 97%, theyre up 82%. i tell you the story all the time. i mean, i have people coming up to me, and a man came up, a policeman. ive told this story, but ive had many, so many times, but this guy in particular, because it was early and that was a year ago. that was a long time ago. right now its much higher than that. but he said, sir, i want to thank you. my wife thinks im a loser. all my life, we never did well with the 401ks, with stocks. everything i invested, im up 72%, sir. she thinks im a financial genius. shes so in love with me. she so in love.    he said, she said, darling, i think youre one of the greatest investors. why dont you do this professionally? and i dont even know what im doing, sir. i just have all these stocks. so i just wanted to tell you, i look at a 401k, who has 401ks here? so thats what i see. i dont care about the rich ones. i care about everybody. i care. i care about everybody actually.    ford motor company just announced that it is investing 1.5 billion dollars into auto factories in the detroit area, creating another 3000 michigan jobs. and thats on top of the many other investments weve gotten from japanese companies, car companies, and other companies. but theyre all coming in and a lot of them are coming to michigan. and i say, hey, go to michigan. sometimes theyll go south and thats okay, whatever. i want them in this country. but ideally i want to fill them up. were doing so well in michigan with the auto companies. now youre back. youre back. so, youre back. very proud of you. very proud of you.    but while were creating jobs, fighting for michigan workers, and achieving numbers that youve never seen before, incredible victories for the american people are happening. the radical left in congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage. you see whats going on? ill tell you, these people are crazy. you ever hear, its the economy, stupid. you know that was clintons saying. if you have a good economy. i have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it. nobody talks about it. if youre a democrat, they say,  oh, its the economy... if the economys any good.    and let me just tell you a little secret. if crooked hillary wouldve won, your economy would have crashed. you were going down. the regulations were taking it down. the taxes were taking it down, instead of being up 92% or whatever youre up, a lot, you would have been down, you would have been at less than half. it was crashing. for all those people that would say, oh, its the obama... let me tell you something. you were dying. and if you look at that first period of a couple of months, it was a disaster, but it was heading south. and as sure as youre standing, and im sorry we couldnt get you seats, we didnt have any room.    and by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. you know? its so cold outside we told them, dont worry about a screen, go home, go home and watch. but we had, this is about a 5,500 seat arena. and i said to my people, why so small? are we spoiled? i watch these guys come in like biden, he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up. no, its true. i dont understand it. and did you see the new polls from usa today came out? im killing everybody. and they hate me. usa today hates me. but theres a poll, were beating everybody.    but, so biden has this rally, theyve got 200 seats, but only a small number of people. so you know what they do? they set up a round table. so think of these people. they come in, they think theyre going to listen to the speech, they end up sitting on a round table discussing... they mustve been happy, right? we dont have enough room for round tables. im sorry folks. no, they set up a round table but i think were doing great. and how do you beat what weve done? with the economy, with our great vets, with choice. youve finally got choice. theyve been trying to get it for almost 50 years.    and these people back here? your seat or stand is better. right? but you know what? theyre going to be much more famous because the cameras cant see you. they can only see them. and the other thing, the cameras, do you ever notice, i go to these stadiums, 25, 30,000 people. they never show the crowd. you know why? because they dont want to have... if crazy pocahontas, if crazy pocahontas goes to the middle of central park or whatever. shes in manhattan. you got me. and people, i mean, i could have, i could have baron trump go into central park and hed get a crowd that would be just as... hes 13. hed get a bigger crowd.    but if she has the crowd, oh, these crowds are so big. ive had crowds over the last couple of weeks. we went to different pennsylvania, florida. but i mean thousands and thousands of people cant get into these nba arenas, right? big arenas. and we set records at everyone because we use the floor. thank you. i appreciate it. but we use the floor, right? the basketball court. so we set records at every arena. they never even mention the crowds. they never mention the crowds. its sort of amazing. you know what? i dont think weve ever had an empty seat from the time i came down the escalator. thats a long time ago. i dont think weve ever had an empty seat. now what the crooked media does though, if you got like over here, look how packed it is and theres thousands outside, but i... please go home. youre going to catch pneumonia. but heres the thing. if this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom, those cameras will turn to those two seats and theyll say trump wasnt able to fill up the arena. i always get nervous when i see some... i know theyre coming back. nobody ever leaves our speeches. because is there a better place to be in the world than a trump rally?    but every time i see a man get up, i see a beautiful woman with a baby and theyre getting up. the babys going crazy and theyre getting up. theyre going to take it... but i know theyre going to be right back. and i say, fill those two seats. i dont want them to see it. because theyll say, couldnt fill up the arena. these are truly dishonest people. after three years of sinister witch hunts, hoaxes, scams, tonight the house democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic americans. capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history. was that the greatest? remember when they all said, remember when they all said, no, no. you cant win michigan. you cant.    then i went, i did one in grand rapids, right? grand rapids. we had 32,000 people that night. it was one oclock in the morning. that means it was election day when i started speaking. hillary, barack obama, michelle obama, and bill clinton, they did an emergency trip. they did an emergency trip to michigan at six oclock. they got here at prime time. they started to speak. she had 500 people. i got here at one oclock in the morning the next day, which is now election day. how many people were there? 32,000 people outside, inside. it was the last speech of michigan. and they say, well, sir, its very hard to win michigan. i said, why would it be hard? heres the beautiful thing. everything i told you ive done, but much more so. i said i was going to bring car companies back. i said i was going to bring in... i just hope you people know that. i just hope you know it.    but ill never forget that night. and in all fairness to bill clinton, he used to be a friend of mine until i ran for office. i like him, i like him. but he told, you know the way they tried to shut him out, right? because hes a pro. hes an instinct guy, right? hes instinct. he doesnt need...    right? because hes a pro. hes an instinct guy, right? hes instinct. he doesnt need polling companies. who the hell wants him? you know, if you want a polling company, pick up the newspaper. the problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. they write fake polls. its true, they write fake polls. you call them suppression polls. you read them and you get depressed, because it looks like youre doing badly. they do that. i think its almost worse than what they write, and you cant get much worse than what they write. so what happens is bill clinton said to crooked hillary, his very dishonest wife, crooked hillary. do you think he calls her crooked hillary? he might. maybe he just calls her crooked?    he said, crooked, im telling you. crooked, i dont like what im seeing in michigan. i dont like what im seeing in wisconsin. he said, i took the trip to wisconsin and ill tell you what, they had those trump/pence signs all the way to the convention area, every lawn, every loan. i dont like wisconsin. and then he said, oh, dont worry about it. what the hell does he know? they told him, what do you know? remember, they shut him out at the ... they didnt want him talking. he was right. i mean, i dont want to cause any problems in the family, but he was right. but he talked about wisconsin. then he talked about michigan. he said, crooked, im telling you, crooked, i dont like what im seeing in michigan. i was in michigan and im telling you, they had those damn signs. i saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn, and two of them on the car.    and he said, you horrible human being. youd better start listening to me, because youre going to get your ass whooped? and you know what happened? you know what happened? she didnt listen, fortunately. and she didnt come to michigan enough. and she didnt come to wisconsin, i think at all, right? because her polling data looked good. it looked good to me, too. every time i went there with these crowds. so we won wisconsin. we won michigan and the great ronna mcdaniel ... where is ronna? where is ronna? ronna, she was so horrible. i didnt know her, ronna mcdaniel, and she was so aggressive. she kept calling and said, could you please come out to michigan? i said, who the hell are you? and i said, what do you mean, another trip? so anyway, i made, we had these big crowds. i made it again. then finally i said, two weeks out, i said, ronna, no more. were going to win it or were not.    okay.    okay. i promise. two days later i get a call, sir, could you please come out to michigan one more time? its true. so, i said, ah. she was the campaign chairman in michigan. so i said, okay. and then i got the ultimate call, 6:00 in the evening for this final deal in grand rapids. sir, could you come to michigan tonight? and i thought, i was just about finished. i went to a last great state, and i said, its over. now i sit back and i watch, and lets see what happens, right? but she said, could you come to michigan? i said, that is the most aggressive human being ive ever met. and we did it. and we won michigan. and the word is that were much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in michigan. you better remember when you walk into ... you know, its november 3rd this time, november 3rd. by the way though, that evening, that incredible evening in november, one of the biggest nights in the history of television. you never hear them say it, so i might as well. that election ... and my debates ... you see their debates are dying. who wants to watch buttigieg, buttigieg? buttigieg! you know that you pronounce it they say ... i heard some guy saying, no, no, because its an unpronounceable name. thats why they call him mayor pete, right? mayor pete. mayor pete. mayor pete! ive had you up to here, mayor pete. no, buttigieg is leading. how does ... no, you say it this way. you say it ... they call him mayor pete, because nobody can pronounce his last name.    thats the only ... people think it says ... by the way, you know what? im not going to say bad things about him. you know why? id love him to win. i thought i knocked off pocahontas. i did it a year too early, a year too early. i give her credit, she then started to come back. i dont think shes going to make it though. shes gasping. shes gasping for air. but i saw them pronouncing buttigieg, and they said, heres what you do, boot edge edge. say, edge, like the edge of a building. edge edge, buttigieg. alfred e. newman. you got to be older to know what that means.    but congressional democrats are directly attacking 2.3 million michigan voters who rose up in 2016, won the state, and now the democrats are very upset. they want to get michigan back. they just dont know how to do it, because they didnt do a thing for michigan. they didnt do anything for michigan. all they did was take away your companies and let them go to mexico and other places. you know, i dont know if you know it, mexico has 32% of your car business. you know that, right? not because of me. theyre not moving. but mexico has ... 32% of our car business moved to mexico. can you believe this? before i got there, but thats what i used to talk about. i said, when i was honored that night, i said, how do you let this happen? how do you let all these companies leave? it used to go, ... its probably maybe the single biggest reason i ran for president. it might be the ... and i had a lot of them. immigration, i had a lot of them, but that may be the single biggest.    with todays illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment, the do nothing democrats, and they are do nothing ... all they want to do is focus on this, what they could be doing ... are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the american voter. this lawless, partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the democrat party. have you seen my polls in the last four weeks? its crazy. its crazy. you know why? because people, we have an election right down the road. i announced three months ago that im running, right? ill give you a little clue. i announced because i figured once i announce, theyd never impeach, nobody would be so stupid.    but theyd been trying to impeach me from day one. theyve been trying to impeach me from before i ran, okay? because if you remember when i ran, i went immediately to number one, never came off number one. we had center stage from day one in the debates. so we had, i dont know, 14, 15 debates. we had a total of 18, actually. people forgot there was one that they never talk about it, but thats okay. but we had 18 people, and i was center stage. and i said, wait a minute, this is no good. i want odd numbers, because of your center stage, if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle. so i said, make it 11 or make it nine, or im not showing up. and generally they did it, because we were way ahead from the beginning. but i made a lot of great friends out of that group, and many of them are good friends today. although you wouldnt know it based on the ... they say that was the meanest ... that was a pretty mean primary, you got to say. wasnt that fun? i liked it.    through their depraved actions today, crazy nancy pelosis house democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame, and it really is. its a disgrace. democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president. they think that the washington swamp, which we believe it or not, it aint easy, because they got so much stacked, including these guys. you know what? these guys are apart of the democrat party. they are a part of it. you might as well call them democrats.    no, the media ... look, look, i know. you know, its hard for somebody to know if youre not the subject, because how do you know the new york times is totally dishonest, or the washington post? or, abc is so bad. cbs, so bad. nbc, i made a lot of money for nbc with the apprentice, a lot of money, a lot. plus we had the number one show a lot, and they had nothing in the top 10 except a thing called the apprentice. and they treat me so bad. i brilliantly said, well, one group i know will treat me well, nbc i call it [commicast 00:42:00]. you know, its owned by commicast. theyre just as bad as cnn, or theyre just as bad as msnbc. and by the way, cnn and msnbc, their ratings are down the tubes. its great. i love it. i love it.    but they think the washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election. thats what they think. theres never been a time like this. think of it, you have the greatest economy in the history of the world. other countries come to see me, all of their leaders, and they say, sir,  first thing, sir, congratulations on your economy. were trying to do the same thing. congratulations, sir. and these guys dont like talking about it. and if they do, they say, obama did it. oh, obama, obama.    remember obama said, you will never be president. he will never be president? then remember he said, i will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president? and then i became president. he wasnt so happy. and in all fairness, he campaigned harder than crooked hillary, because he had more strength. i mean, i go to these places, secret service, they take me. i havent seen a lobby in three years. its true. i go through basements. i pass compactor plants. i know more about compactors from this job. i dont see lobbies. i say fellows, you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby?    no, sir.    but ill tell you what. i go upstairs, downstairs, all around. theyre taking me up three flights, go down one. i said, are we almost there?    yes, sir, another four flights. and i say, you think hillary could do this? i dont think so. theyd bring her back home. she wants to go to sleep. and now i hear she wants to run again. wouldnt that be great? oh. thank you. thank you. oh would we love that? you think the democrats are screwed up? wait until that happens. wouldnt that be ... oh, theres my guy.    lock her up. lock her up. lock her up.    well look, based on the fbi report, you just saw what happened with the ig, where they came out with the fbi. based on that, you know what? i never stopped you. but now, think of what they did. think of what they did. think of how dishonest it all was. they shouldnt even be allowed to have an impeachment, because it was based on dishonesty. it was based on illegality. she went out, and they paid for a fake dossier. they gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier, totally disproven, totally fake. the fbi then took that fake dossier and they used it in the fisa court to get approval to spy on my campaign. and if we were democrats, they wouldve been in jail two years ago. its a disgrace. think of what they did. so they use this fake dossier, and they brought it before this big deal court. its a big deal, the fisa court. and they said this stuff, and they lied about it, because comey, whos another beauty ... did i do a great job when i fired his ass? what a great job.    oh no, they had bad plans. no, i did a great thing. that was like throwing a rock at a hornets nest. did that place explode? and then we learned about lisa page, and her wonderful lover, peter strzok. i love you lisa. i love you more than anybody in the world. i love you more than anybody in the world. it causes problems with the wife, but we wont talk about that. those tapes didnt work well. no, how about those statements, right? and then they say, in all fairness, ... i really liked the report, but how does the inspector general say ... because dont forget, he was appointed by obama. so im not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets, but we had a lot of those nuggets. how does the inspector general say, you have these horrible ... hes going to lose. isnt he? hes going to lose, or shes going to win 100 million. did you see all the zeros? it was like ... im blinking. i says, i think its 100.    hes going to lose 100 to one. isnt he peter? i love you so much, peter. ive never loved anyone like you. hes going to lose 100 million to one, peter, right?    thats right. hes going to lose 100 million to one. but theres no bias. how about the insurance policy? to me, the greatest. just in case she loses, we have an insurance policy! were in the insurance policy right now folks! weve been in it for three years, thats what they meant. i mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator, because were doing awfully well. and ill tell you something, rush limbaugh said it. sean hannity said it. laura ingram said it. tucker said it. ainsley said it, but a lot of people have said it. they said, theres nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened, and still created one of the greatest economies, and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years.    i understand that. i understand that, but its my life, very unfair to my family. i have to say this very, very unfair to my family. what they put my family through is a disgrace. me, its my life. its fine. i do. but you know what? what they put my family through is a disgrace, and they ought to be ashamed, and we should get apologies all over the place. so yesterday i sent pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her partys outrageous abusive power. thats what it is. they have nothing. theyre the ones that should be impeached, every one of them. i mean you got this guy, schiff. he makes up a statement, and he goes in front of congress where he has immunity, and he makes up a statement from me thats totally fictitious, totally out of thin air. the worst statement ive ever heard. many people saw it. i had a person two weeks ago that said, i didnt love the statement you made. i said, really? didnt you read the transcripts? i always say, read the transcript. but didnt you read it    no, no. i heard it on television. i watched adam schiff. he made it up. i then sent him the transcript. he said, oh, now i feel better. thats perfect. i call it perfect. he called it perfect. everyone calls it, if you read it. but heres the thing. he makes up this statement, and it finished. didnt he have eight quid pro quos? eight. could you imagine, youre dealing with a country, and you say eight times that youve got to do something. the first time they say, well. the second time they say, thats strange. third time they say, whats wrong? you said eight times? eight times. theyd have you arrested. theyd have you put into an insane asylum. but he actually said ... i think he said eight, not seven, eight. and then he finished with, dont call me, ill call you. can you imagine? the president of the united states, dont call me, ill call you.    you know what that is? thats a mafia statement, okay? thats the head of the mafia saying, dont call me. this guy actually said that, and then he walked away and people became incensed, because they knew that wasnt the people that read the thing. most people believed him.    hes a liar!    because you know, hes a corrupt politician, 100%. no, hes a corrupt ... and then i see him. by the way, you ever see this guy? he walks up to the mics. i mean, were not ... all fairness, look, i dont want to be ... because with me too, i never even think about looks anymore, okay? i dont talk about looks of a male or a female, but in his case, lets just say ... the last time ill ever refer to this. hes not exactly the best looking guy weve ever seen. no, any mic. he walks up to the mic, and hes so just, this is a sad, sad day for america. our president is an employee of russia. i have absolute proof that the president, this is at the beginning, and every week theyd say, wheres the proof?    its coming. its coming. then we get the mueller report, nothing. and ill tell you what, i know some of the people in this audience. if i spent not $45 million, not 18 trump haters, i call them the angry democrats. it was 13, then it went to 18, and then mueller. did muller do a good job? did he do a good job?    no! boo!    how was his performance in front of congress?    boo!    not the best, but think of this, $45 million they spent. and you know, i heard somebody say, well, we got back some of that money. let me tell you, you cost this country billions, and billions, and billions of dollars in all of the things that didnt get done, in all of the embarrassment to our country. you caused billions and billions of dollars, and it was a hoax. but this guy, schiff, i have absolute proof. i have this. i have that, this, that. anytime he sees a camera and hes stone faced, stone faced. hes a pathological liar. he gets up, and ive never seen anything like it. even i was saying, i wonder what he has. what does he have? he says, i have absolute, i said, i havent spoken to russia in year. what the hell do i have to do with russia? but this guy gets up ... oh, i think we have a vote coming in.    so we got every single republican voted for us. whoa, whoa, wow, wow, almost 200. so we had 198. 229, 198. we didnt lose one republican vote, and three democrats voted for us, [haleigh 00:00:53:20]. haleigh! wow! thank you, haleigh, great job. wow. the republican party has never been so affronted, but theyve never been so united as they are right now, ever, never. and i know the senators, and theyre great guys, and women too. we have some great women. we have great guys. theyre great people. they love this country. theyre going to do the right thing. theyre going to do the right thing.    so i said in my letter to pelosi ... i love that. you know, usually theres one, two. the republicans, look, ive said it for a long time. the democrats are lousy politicians, they really are. theyve got horrible policies, open borders, crime is fine, drugs pouring through. i mean, think of what they do. sanctuary cities, they love sanctuary cities. theyre lousy politicians, but they have one thing ... two things. they are vicious. theyre the most vicious people. the republicans arent as vicious. they may learn to be vicious after going through this, though. but the other thing, the democrats always stick together. now think of it, three democrats went over to our side, no republicans. its unheard of.    and by the way, this is for a hundred years. im not just talking about this little point in time. the republicans are known as, its always harder to stick together. these people are great. we have a great republican party, and we have to get that change. we have to take back the house. youll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take ... and by the way, we had another victory. the individual mandate, just a little while ago, it came over the wires, it was just upheld. the individual mandate is now gone. the most unpopular part of obamacare. it was just upheld.    so i said in my letter to pelosi, by proceeding with your invalid impeachment, youre violating your oath of office. youre breaking your allegiance to the constitution. youre declaring open war on american democracy. you dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme, yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for americas founding, and your egregious conduct. and listen though, its so true, it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged, and in fact their very lives to build. you are the ones interfering in americas elections. you are the one subverting americas democracy. we did nothing wrong, nothing whatsoever. this was just an excuse. you are the ones that are obstructing justice. you are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish, personal, political and partisan gain.    theyre bringing pain. the work we could be doing on lowering drug prices, on getting rid of these horrible, horrible situations. you know in the border ... the woman is okay? is she okay? okay, thank you very much. thank you. i mean, some of these people are waiting here for three days, right? thank you. theyll come back. come back.    merry christmas!    thank you. merry christmas is true. but what theyve done with this perversion, its perversion. and when you watch some of these people get up and speak today, they dont even ... you have violated the constitution.    well, what does he done wrong?    well, we dont know that. they dont even have any crime. this is the first impeachment where theres no crime. i say, tell me what i did, please.    well, we dont know. you violated the constitution. you had turley, whos smart, alan dershowitz, these guys. all of them, they said, theres no crime. theres no crime, right?    theres no crime!    theres no crime! im the first person that ever get impeached, and theres no crime. i feel guilty. you know what they call it? impeachment light. its impeachment light. thats why, with richard nixon, i just see it as a very dark era, very dark, very ... oh, you dont even like to think. i dont know about you, but im having a good time, its crazy. but i also know we have a great group of people behind us in the republican party, we really do. maybe i wouldnt feel the same way, but we have a great group of people behind us. we had in the house, and we have it in the senate. theyre doing a great job, so im not worried. im not worried, because its always good when you dont do anything wrong, you get impeached. that may be a record that will last forever.    but you know what they have done? theyve cheapened the impeachment process. and now anybody that become ... this is a sacred position. anybody that becomes president, i mean, they could have a phone call and they get impeached. so if the republicans ... if you had a democrat as president, we have a republican house, they dont like the guy for whatever reason, or the woman, they impeach the person. its cheapened it. its exactly what our founding fathers didnt want, and they said it could happen, and its happened. but i know one thing, americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote pelosi the hell out of office.    but its so disappointing. i see a woman, carolyn maloney. shes a long time, nothing much, believe me. shes a congresswoman from manhattan, the east side. i was with her. her first race, i helped her. she was always so nice, oh, thank you, thank you. i made lots of contributions over the years. in new york, if youre not a ... its purely democrat, especially in manhattan. so what happens? i make lots of contributions for years, and years, and years. i go run. the first person i see, carolyn maloney. i raise my hand to impeach. well, give me back the damn money that ive been paying her for so many years. let her pay me back all the money. let her pay me back all the money.    then you have this dingell. dingell, you know dingell, from michigan. you know dingell? you ever hear of her, michigan? debbie dingell, thats a real beauty. so she calls me up like eight months ago. her husband was here a long time, but i didnt give him the b treatment. i didnt give him the c or the d. i couldve. nobody what is, you know? i gave the a+ treatment. take down the flags.    while youre taking them down for ex-congressman dingell ...    oh, okay?     ... do this, do that, do that, rotunda everything. i gave him everything. thats okay. i dont want anything for it. i dont need anything for anything. she calls me up. its the nicest thing thats ever happened. thank you so much. john would be so thrilled. hes looking down. hed be so thrilled. thank you so much, sir. i said, thats okay, dont worry about it. maybe hes looking up? i dont know. i dont know. maybe, maybe. but lets assume hes looking down. but i gave him a+, not a, not b+, not b. i gave him the a+, and she called me. she said, oh, no. i wont go into the conversation, because its not fair do that. but all i want to say is, lets put it this way, it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10, it was a 10. okay, so that was what? february or something. now they talk about this phony impeachment, and shes out there, well, we have to look seriously at our president, because he may have violated the constitution of the united states.    boo!    and i cant be happy with that, because i love our country. i love this, and i love that. she loves everything. i said, shes a no, okay? no, but i look at her, and shes so sincere, and what happens? i vote to impeach trump. and you know what? i didnt say, who the hell knew this was even going to come up? i went through the whole muller hoax. they did this big report. i was totally exonerated. they didnt even bring it up at the impeachment, because i was totally exonerated. if they saw one little kernel, one little quarter of a sentence ... look what they did with one word. remember this, what did i do? why did i do? its us. but they dont say it that way. they say, i. they read it totally different, schiff and his band of thieves, they read it.    now i say basically, very simple, do us a favor, our country. do us! do us! not me! our country! and then what do i say? i say, the united states attorney general, attorney general of the united states could speak to you, it would be great, okay? because its known for major corruption. in fact, the new leader of ukraine got in on a construction ... on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty, and everything that was going on in ukraine, right? he looked for it, thats how he got into office. he got into office that way.    so we take it and they repeat it a thousand times, and they never say with the right ... so i go wild, and we start. and the republicans have got it right. now we always correct him, but i use the word us. us is the united states, our country. and then it actually says, i think, comma, country, but they dont say that. they say, do me a favor. how many times have you heard it? where they say in a speech? and then the president said, do me a favor. well, thats not what i said. i said, do us a favor, our country. and then i said, the attorney general of the united states, i didnt say my campaign-    i said the attorney general of the united states, i didnt say my campaign manager. okay? i said the attorney ... and these people want to impeach the president of the united states for that?    oh, and then what happened? right? then what happened? so then, the president of ukraine, whos a quality person, said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever. that was a killer for the democrats, right? then his foreign minister said the same thing. he said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever. there was no pressure. thats a killer. so now did you see what the democrats did a couple of days ago? they tried to say that hes not a strong person, that he was weak. they used the word weak, that he was weak, and under the power of trump, he said. do you know how insulting that is? anybody that becomes president of a country, and thats a big country and its a tough country, you got to be tough. hes tough. but so what theyre saying now is he was weak because the wording, it just doesnt fit. okay? these are really dishonest people. and if the press was fair, this thing never would have happened.    so the house democrats are surrendering their majority, their dignity, their reputations. they look like a bunch of fools. and ill tell you, we have a lot of new stars in the republican party, i could read off a list of 20 names. but theyre giving up their honor, and theyll receive a big backlash at the box office. when you take a look, that ballot box, that ballot box on november 3rd, i think were going to have crowds like weve never had.    and ill tell you something, it used to be, theyd always say, oh, the republicans. you know, in 2018, i didnt run. i didnt run, right? they all said, oh, we didnt. well actually, we picked up two seats in the senate that these guys never talk about. we just approved 171 federal court justices, 171 federal justices, including courts of appeal, 171. well be up, probably by the end of the year, to 182, and for that, i thank president obama. he gave me 142 openings. he gave me 142. i said to him, my people, i got there, because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and supreme court.    we have two great supreme court judges. right? two justices of the supreme court, kavanaugh, gorsuch. two great men. theyre great. and how about the pain that they put justice kavanaugh through, right? over a phony deal, i hate to tell you. over a phony deal. what a disgrace, what they put that man through and that family through. just remember it come november. you got to remember, its a long time. you know, in the life of trump, 10 months is an eternity. its a long time. somebody said, congratulations sir, youre going to win. i said, dont say that. just dont talk about it. lets always pretend youre one point down. like last time. going to be close. nope, its going to be close. but what they put that man through was horrible, what they put his family through was horrible. and you know, those stories largely have been recanted. and frankly, the ones that didnt recant, i dont know what a supreme court judge does, but he should sue them. he should sue them.    so we want to take back the house, well hold the senate, and well keep the white house. you will have the greatest healthcare. you will continue with the greatest judges. you know, we have judges that are ... we just had a great story in the wall street journal. i have to be always very truthful, because if im a little bit off, they call me a liar. theyll say, he gets a pinocchio, the stupid washington post, they have pinocchio. i mean, even if youre saying things perfectly, its a pinocchio. theres nothing you can say where you dont get a pinocchio. but what happens, what happens is we have wall street journal the other day got the best story. they said, whether you like him or not, the job hes done on judges and supreme court justices, but the job hes done on judges is amazing. say its the most important thing.    see, i dont agree. i say defense is the most, the military is the most. but once youre beyond the military, i mean to me defense is the most important. because without good defense, maybe we dont need judges so much, right? its like somebody said, well, we violated the budget. i said, do me a favor, dont worry about the budget. if were attacked and arent doing very well and somebody says, well, at least we have a good budget, that doesnt work too well. right? that doesnt work. so we have great military, we have great judges, we have great everything.    drug prices down. for the first time in 51 years, drug prices came down. and that was with no help from the democrats. if they helped, because you need their votes, if they helped, i could get those drug prices down 40 and 50%. okay? and we just approved, and were approving very soon for the governor of florida, ron desantis, where he can buy, he has the right to go, were giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country, where the prices for the identical drug, identical drug are 50% less. hes going to do that for the people of florida. and were going to do that for your governors if they want to do that. well get that down so far.    everyone in america can see straight through the washington democrats phony, dangerous charade. schiff makes up so many things. pelosi makes it up, and she backs him up. i saw her on a television show, and george stephanopoulos, thats another beauty, he said, even he said, he was defending me. i couldnt believe it. he made this statement, but you know he lied on that. he made up this stuff. no, he didnt, he didnt. so that means nancy pelosi said no, the statement that he made up. but its all going to end soon, and its going to come out to a beautiful, great victory for the republican party and for this nation.    thank you very much. so thats it. we have the greatest country. weve turned around a ship. we need four more years. if we dont have it ... now, if you want to drive them crazy, we had one group in pennsylvania, some guy started screaming,  16 more years. 16. they went crazy. and you know what they dont understand? when i do get out, theyre all going to go out of business. theyre making more money than theyve ever made.    that crazy new york times, one of the worst newspapers in the world, one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world, totally phony. they came out with a story, where it was a great headline for me, and the people that read it, the super radical left, they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story. can you believe it? no, theyre among the most dishonest people.    but ill never forget, before i took that great escalator ride down with our first lady ... our first lady is doing a great job, great job. i said, first lady, youre so lucky i took you on this journey, this wonderful, beautiful journey. and it is. you know why its a wonderful, beautiful journey? because look at, what were accomplishing is unbelievable. its unprecedented. it is unprecedented what were accomplishing. youre so lucky, i said it to all my people. i have great people in the back. i say, you folks are so lucky i took you on this. you could be home right now, relaxing.    but id rather be here, frankly, than any place. these rallies are great. theyre inspiring. you are inspiring. and you know, its funny, were not even into election season. yeah, its a long way away. were not even in it. and yet, i think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election. does that make any sense? i think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt. a lot of it has to do with the phony, witch hunt because youre smart people. youre the elite. theyre not the elite. youre the elite.    youre the elite. you do better than they do. they talk about it, dont you hate it? well, the elite ...  oh really? i went to better schools. many of you went to better schools. we wont talk about homes, even though your homes are nicer. we wont talk about jobs. you see the jobs reports? you see whats happening? do you see where wages are going up?    you know, when i first started, when i was here, one of my first speeches, i was talking that people made more money, that was four years ago, so it was 20 years before that, so thats 24, 25 years ago. they made more money 24 years ago than they were making when i got elected president. and they worked one job versus two or three jobs. now its going up beautifully and we want that, the salaries. and you know, the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker. its percentage, the best. the blue collar worker. they had two and three jobs. the blue collar worker is going up the most.    anyway, so you know what else? the thing im happiest about, african american unemployment, the lowest in the history of our country. african american. remember i used to say, you remember, look at, you. are you the greatest guy? everyone thinks, do i pay? im telling you, i have a group of african american guys, and gals by the way, that follow me around and they think i pay them, and i dont. i love them, they love me. they come. how many rallies have you come to? a lot. theyre great people, just great. thank you. i dont even know who the hell he is. is that right? i dont know him, but i like him. i see him at so many rallies. i appreciate it. you and your group, theyre great people. thank you. so youre obviously doing well if you can travel around like that, right? ah, he knows. i appreciate it, i really do. i think its fantastic. thank you. thank you.    but think of this, african-american unemployment is the lowest its ever been in the history of our country. their poverty levels, they had a horrible poverty level, in the negative sense, now their poverty levels are the best theyve ever been in the history of our country. same with hispanic americans, the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. and the same with asians, the best unemployment. and women, im sorry, 71 years, best in 71 years. ive let the women down! but i think within another couple of months, youll be historical. so only 71 years best. the best in 71 years.    but what were doing has been an incredible thing. its an incredible thing. when im on the debate stage with one of these characters, and they try and say negative stuff, ill just say, well, heres the story. in the history of our country, this group is doing the best, and that group is doing the best, and the women are doing the best, and everybodys doing. and frankly, you know what it is? the whole countrys doing the best. okay? the whole country is doing the best.    so we have records and everything, and yet theyre trying to, and they really are, ive never seen anything like it, theyre accusing me, really, of doing what joe biden ... biden admitted what he did. how about this? they protect him. did you see the crummy debate? those debates are so boring. theyre dying in the ratings. theyre dying, theyre dying.  while its totally unsupported! whats unsupported? hes on tape saying that hes holding back $1 billion from ukraine unless you change the prosecutor. how about that question? i wont say who answered, because you know im not, i actually used to like the guy, he was a nice guy to me, but now i dont like him so much, but thats okay.    but he goes, while its totally unsubstantiated, and while we beg your mercy that were asking you even to bring up this question, but president trump said you refused to give $1 billion of taxpayer money to ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your sons company. and sleepy joe gives a sleepy answer, and thats the end of it. thats it. then whenever i bring it up, do you ever notice they always use,  while these charges are totally unsubstantiated? hes on tape! if that were me, its the electric chair. they would bring the electric chair back. no, the guys on tape, and they always say its unsubstantiated. it is not supported by fact, one of them the other day, they finally changed the word. it is supported by fact. no, its supported by tape. no, its unbelievable. in many ways, id like to have him win because number one, hes going to have to eventually answer that question, and number ... she said he doesnt know where he is. thats the other problem.    now, ive been doing this for a long time, and i have much bigger crowds than anybodys ever had in history. by the way, do you know what? i say it against the fake news, because you know what theyre going to say. every stadium is packed. i give my people one instruction, get the largest stadium you can get. now, thats why i was a little surprised. but in battle creek, you dont have that many, right? not too many stadiums. but i wanted to be here. you know why i wanted to be here?    first of all the crowd is incredible. the crowd outside. but let me tell you. no, you know why i wanted to be here? because we have a lot of choices, but i wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly, and i said, i want to be there. pretty simple, pretty simple. pretty simple. i wanted to be here for that reason, and i just want to say thank you, because ill tell you what, you came in ... i dont know, i didnt get 100%, but we got a damn good percentage, right? we got a damn good percentage. so its really thrilling to be here.    but were joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders. your michigan house speaker, lee chatfield. wheres lee? lee, come up if you want. come on, what the hell, we have nothing else to do. should we get him up? yes. come up lee, come up lee, get up here. come on up, lee. republican party chairwoman, ronna mcdaniel, who i spoke to. and the bottom line on the end of her story, so when i won i said, whos going to head up the rnc? i said, i got to get that woman from michigan. remember they were all saying, you cant win michigan? now were going to win it by so much, you better remember all those. every time a car plant opens, please think about trump. come on up here, lee. michigan gop chairwoman, laura cox. thank you.    hate to tell you, but all your congressmen, you know where they are right now. your congressmen, all of your congresspeople, men, wonderful people, theyre at a place called congress right now. theyre doing an unbelievable job of supporting your president and supporting you. they had a choice, sir, should we leave and be there? i said, dont leave. stay right where you are. thats why we got that vote. thats some vote, right lee? the chairman of the womans workers and workers for trump, and a proud union autoworker, terry bowman, whos been so terrific. thank you, terry. come on up. and while democrats are obsessed with impeachment, were focused on jobs, jobs, jobs. this group, local leaders. and all your washington folks, they are right where they have to be in washington tonight. thank you. thank you. great job. thank you very much.    weve eliminated more job-killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country, whether its four years or eight years, or in one case, much more than eight years. in a period of two and a half years, we have eliminated more regulations than any other president, by far. youre saving almost $3,000 a year because of regulation cuts. total income gains for median households will reach $10,000 a family.    ill give you a couple of quick numbers. so under president bush, for eight years, you saved $450, meaning you took in 450 bucks. okay, fine. under president obama, you took in $975. under president trump, including the energy savings, and the regulation savings, and the tax cut savings, its more than $10,000 in less than three years. pretty good, right? so for two eight-years, you had a 400, 450, and a 975. thats eight years. 450. in less than three years, you had more than $10,000. that goes right into your pockets. its one of the reasons our economy is doing well, because, as they say, the consumer is doing better than theyve ever done. and thats great, thats what we wanted.    weve ended the war on american energy, and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth. and these maniacs want to close it up. how about going to texas? you know beto? what? remember what he said, i said, oh, this guys a loser. you know a salesman, like if youre a great salesman, you never talk that youre a great salesman. you dont walk in and say, well, im a great salesman. i can sell ...  any guy that does that, theyre no good. its those quiet type that get you. you know, the ones that dont talk. so beto, when he first got in, remember this clown? he gets in, no, no, he gets in. i was made for this job, to run for president. after about two weeks, they killed him. he was gone.    but you remember, he was against the bible, he was against religion, he was against guns, and he was against oil and gas. and he comes from texas. i said, thats a platform. think of it. hes against religion, hes against guns, and against oil and gas. think of it. i dont like to bring it up because hes gone zone, but he comes from texas. i said, abraham lincoln cant win in texas with that platform. but they are, all of them, they want to close up your energy. its a big deal. they want to close up your steel mills. they dont want your steel mills. look at what ive done for steel. i mean, the steel is back. we taxed all of the dump steel coming in from china and other places, and your steel mills that are doing great, theyre expanding all over the country. and they were going to be out of business within two years. the way they were going, they were gone. united states steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions.    every major democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the u.s. auto industry forever. and you know why? because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric. i want to have an alternative, a big alternative. youre going to always have the alternative. and a lot of people dont know of the electric can ever catch the gas, you know? and by the way, therell be different forms of energy coming along. but they want to close them up, and were not closing them up. were going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing, you can have it for a lot of different reasons.    were even bringing back the old light bulb. you heard about that, right? the old light bulb, which is better. i say, why do i always look so orange? you know why? because of the new light, theyre terrible. you look terrible. they cost you many, many times more, like four or five times more. and you know theyre considered hazardous waste. when a light bulb is out, youve got to bring it to a dump. so lets say, over here in battle creek, wheres your nearest dump? okay, thats what, a couple of hundred miles away. so every time you lose ... drive a couple of hundred miles, right? i said, how many people do that? nobody. what do they do? they throw it in the garbage. but you know what it is, because its all gas. its much more expensive, four or five times more.    and i came into office, i did a lot of this. sinks, showers, all of this stuff, i did a lot of it. no water comes out. you have areas where theres so much water, you dont know what to do with it. you turn on the shower, youre not allowed to have any water anymore. i mean, we do a lot of it. dishwashers, we did the dishwasher, right? you press it. remember the dishwasher, youd press it, boom, thered be like an explosion, five minutes later you open it up, the steam pours out, the dishes. now you press it 12 times, the women tell me, again. you know, they give you four drops of water, and theyre in places where theres so much water, they dont know what to do with it.    so we just came out with a reg on dishwashers. were going back to the old. by the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water, and electric. dont forget, the whole thing is worse because youre spending all that money on electric. so were bringing back standards that are great, and better machinery that you can have the water again, right?    but with the light bulb, i said, whats going on with the light bulbs? a lot of people are complaining about the cost. so i had a couple of experts come in, i said, tell me, what gives a better light? well, we liked the old light bulb better. i said, i like it better. and so what i did is you can have either one. if you want to buy the newer kind, you can. and if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind, like i do. so were bringing back the old light bulb. so its a much less expensive, it probably gives a better light. but whatever it is, and youll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb. i mean, it sounds like little, but its big stuff. okay? its big stuff, and were doing it with a lot of other things, our dishwashers.    and you know, i wont tell you one of the things, because every time i tell you, they do a big number on it. you know the one im talking about, right? sinks, right? showers. and what goes with a sink and a shower? 10 times, right? 10 times. not me, of course, not me, but you, him. but i never mention that, because one time i mentioned all three, i said, sinks, showers, and toilets. the headline was, trump with the toilets, toilets. thats all they want. they dont even mention it. so i didnt mention that, okay? i go off the record. but you know what? its terrible. you want to wash your hands, you turn on the sink, no water comes out. so you leave the water going 10 times as long, its the same thing.    you have a shower, drip. its no good for me. for me. you know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business? they always used to say i wore a hairpiece. its okay. i know people wear hairpieces. but they always used to say. they dont say that anymore because i have been through the worst storms. if you wear one of those suckers, you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you. you look handsome, dont worry about it.    but in the last two decades before my election, we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country. the people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that theyve wanted to do for so many years. and thats why it doesnt work. we look so forward to taking it on, and it is all about cleaning the swamp, draining the swamp, and we have a very, very big, bad, dangerous swamp. okay, thats enough of that. thats enough.    so among the very first acts that i did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the u.s. auto industry. i withdrew from the horrible trans pacific partnership. that would have ended your auto industry. a lot of people dont know that, but i do. remember tpp? we were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off. the people that made these trade deals, its like, where do they come? like the one in korea, that was a hillary clinton special. she said, this will produce 250,000 new jobs. and i said, well, what happened? he said, well, she was right. except it was for south korea, not for us. no, its true. it produced 250,000 jobs for south korea. these deals were so bad.    but now theyre getting really good, and some of them are getting great, and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal. wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time. but we have to go through a little pain, because we have to do it, and then they all say, were going to withdraw, and then i say, you can withdraw, i dont care. were putting tariffs on your country. then they say, wed love to make a deal, sir.    the new usmca has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan where they belong. since the election, weve created 41,000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs, manufacturing jobs. remember the statement by president obama? youd have to wave a magic wand. remember the magic wand? because manufacturing ... and i said, you know, that sounds strange. what do you do if you dont have manufacturing? how do you make things? right? manufacturing jobs wont happen. well, weve got 600,000 manufacturing jobs, and youre going to see a big, big increase.    the truth is, we need more people. you know what? we need more people. we need more people coming into the country, and theyre going to come in, and theyre going to come in through merit, and theyre going to love our country, and theyre going to respect our country, and theyre going to work. we do need more people. theyre opening these massive, foxconn in wisconsin, theyre opening these massive plants and its hard to get people. we want people coming in, but they have to come in, only they have to come in through merit.    fiat-chrysler recently announced a $4.5 billion investment in michigan, including the first new auto plant in detroit in more than a generation. and general motors recently announced a $300 million investment at its orion assembly plant right here in michigan. come on, general motors, lets go. general motors gave us a little hard time with one building. i wasnt happy about that. that was the only building i had a problem within the whole car industry, right? right? you know the one im talking about. i didnt like that. anyway, but theyre spending money, you know, what can i tell you?    but these companies are coming in, a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to. i say, you have to, or were not trading with you anymore. because we had such big deficits with these countries. with japan, we had a $68 billion deficit. i said, shinzo, hes great prime minister of japan. but he said, but nobody has ever asked us to do this. i said, im asking you. they are building many, many plants. theyre building many plants now in the united states, the japanese.    and after years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. is that okay? we were surrounded with globalists. you know, they think its okay. you open a plant in some country that you never heard of, they make your product, they send it. in the meantime, they close all their factories here. were not doing that anymore. those are globalists. they think its wonderful to have deficits. i dont. they think its great. its a great thing to have deficits. no, those are globalists. the globalists are passe.    on no issue have democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the american people than immigration. every democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world, overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk. my administration has taken bold action to reduce the influx of refugees, and we are making sure local communities like yours have a much greater say about who gets admitted into your own neighborhoods. some of these stories are so sad. some of the stories are so sad. when it comes to setting immigration policy, we always remember this sacred truth: our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you, the american people, before anybody else. we must care for our own-    we must care for our own citizens first democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent americans. i dont even know whats happening. its terrible. and weve moved out thousands and thousands of ms13 thugs out of our country.    and we have agreements now with guatemala, honduras, el salvador. they didnt use to take them back. if we had a murderer, then we should get them the hell out. we dont really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50, 60 years. we want to bring them back. they wouldnt take them. the planes used to go around and around, dont land, dont land. with us, they land. we worked out deals with every one of them. we stopped giving them all the aid. were giving them all this money and then they said, were not going to let you land. were not going to let you take them back. i said, thats okay. 500 million, we were giving them. i said, now we give them $5 we give them nothing. all of a sudden they said, we would love to have them back. we would love it. its wonderful to have them back.    in june, two illegal aliens in sandusky, michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife. then, they hid her body in a water drain. a criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death, a single mother of five young children. its happening all the time.    far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities, which deliberately release dangerous, violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets. we had a great election in north carolina recently, two great congressmen got elected, you dont hear about it, when they win, you dont ever hear about it, just a few months ago. two great people and they got elected and they got elected because i went in and said, talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities. soon as i mentioned that, boom, they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great. great thing.    the sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you, the people of california, they dont like sanctuary cities either. theyre stuck with them because they have crazy politicians. earlier this year, authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of kent county, michigan, anybody know kent county? released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle. they let him go to roam free in michigan communities. if you want to end sanctuary cities in michigan, if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens, if you want to have a safe life, frankly, its so crazy what theyre doing. you wouldnt even believe it. you have only one choice in 2020, you must vote republican.    thank you. im surprised. as you know, you do have sanctuary cities in michigan. i was almost surprised to hear it, but you have them. its one of those progressive things? they think theyre doing a wonderful favor for the world. and now were getting these prosecutors that, you murder somebody, they give you two months, they fight that you dont even have to go to jail. whats going on is crazy. thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75% since may and weve ended catch and release. weve ended it. we couldve ended it so easily. its called the loophole. you catch him and then you release him into a country. thats what you had to do by law. and if you dont do that, they arrest the border patrol people. you believe this? the border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people.    remember the caravans coming up, we call them caravans, and theyre interviewing the people. ill never forget it. one nice citizen reporter, female reporter, and what did you do? well, i want to come to america. okay, good. what did you do? murder. what? this was on live television. they didnt play that clip too long. one of the beauties back there, what did you do? murder. [ay, yi, yi 00:04:46] these are the people because look, when you have a caravan of eight or 10,000 people, a lot of those people, do you think that guatemala, honduras, el salvador, do you think theyre sending us their finest? i dont think so. alright.    how about the lottery? that was a schumer deal. chuck schumer, crying chuck, crying chuck schumer. i used to be a big contributor to him, he used to kiss my ass, chuck schumer. hed do anything. he wouldve done anything for me. anything i asked him, get schumer on the phone, you do this, you do that. you get him on the phone, that son of a bitch. he would have done, i didnt need anything, but he would have done anything. now its like, the prisoner has not acted-. give me a break. give me a break. find out how much money did i give a raise to chuck schumer and chuck, give all that money back please.    carolyn maloney, give that money back. every penny should come back. they act so pompous. they act so righteous. theyre not righteous. theyre not righteous. theyre bad people. the far left democrats have never been more extreme than they are now. democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor. 180 million people are going to lose. a lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us thats phenomenal. and thats what you want. they want to take it away, 180. they want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night. i dont think so. not in this group. and you know what? some people, its good so people, but can you imagine? they want to take away 180 million people, great, private, highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor.    remember obama? 28 times, you can have your doctor, you can have your plan. didnt work out that way, did it? i think we should impeach him for that. lets impeach him, for that, for the irs scandal, for the guns. remember the guns, he was giving them to anybody that wanted them. he gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didnt have them registered, right? not to good. impeach him. why didnt the republicans impeach him? those were really, how about giving around $1.8 billion in cash? how about that?    by the way, i ended the iran nuclear deal. i hope you happy, much different country. but how about giving iran $1.8 billion in cash. many big planes going over to iran, loaded up to the ceiling with cash. you know what $1.8 billion, you ever see like at a casino, $1 million wrapped up? its a big pile of stuff, thats a million. now multiply it, $1.8 billion in cash he gave. so, why is he allow to do that? did anybody try to impeach him for that? everybody knew it was wrong. republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians. virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the moment of birth. right?    that is why ive asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god. democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. and thats what it is. the republican party is the party of the american worker, the american family, and the american dream. and thats really what it is. were also the party of the great abraham lincoln. a lot of people forget that, but we have to bring it up. to protect the health and safety of our citizens, we awarded $100 million to improve water infrastructure in flint. how badly was flint? who were the geniuses that did that to you? you have clean water coming into flint. they had to pay a very tiny little fee. so instead, they go into this horrible, horrible, really polluted water and the water comes out of there.    they spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks, and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people. it hurt the people. but were getting it fixed. and i know your previous governor was a republican, but i was not a big fan of his. i was not, but im not a big fan of the one that cant fix the potholes either. were committed to ensuring america has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth, and thats what its about. its about clean air and its about clean, beautiful water. and its about keeping our industry, not closing it because of the ridiculous paris climate accord. hows paris doing? i dont think too well. hows paris doing with the yellow vests? the yellow vests? you know why? because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in france never heard of. its not working out too well.    were lowering prices. were lowering taxes. were making it possible. i mean, look at gas prices now. look at gas prices. i recognize israels true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem. and we also recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights. big deal. for years, you watched as your politicians apologized. member, i would like to apologize. i would like to apologize. nah, we dont apologize. now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of michigan. youre getting your auto industry back. at stake in our present battle is the survival of the american nation. if you want your children to grow up, a land of safety, its really, we want a land of safety, justice. well, i dont know. when i look at those fbi reports we got out, we got to clean up a lot.    what theyve done to hurt people, what theyve done to hurt with comey and these horrible people, what theyve done to hurt people. i think one of the best things i did as president, a lot of people would say, with all what weve done for the economy and, but one of the best things is firing james comeys ass out of there. boy, those reports are kept. did you see the other day? well, ah, ah. first time now he said, in other words, hes 50% there folks. hes hit the golden pond. anyway, so what were doing is, were doing things that are going to make our victory, its like a tree. we need that extra four years. weve done so much, even right to try.    you know right to try? people were traveling, theyre terminally ill, theyre traveling all over the world. we have the best medical in the world, the best doctors, the best labs, best hospital. theyre traveling all over the world, to try and get, because it takes years to get something approved. and i said, wait a minute folks, why arent we doing this? and theyve been trying to do it for 49 years. they couldnt get it done. not that easy. the drug companies didnt want the liability, the country didnt want the liability, the insurance companies didnt want the liability.    i said, heres what we do. well sign an agreement with the people where youre exculpated from all liability. huh? thats a good idea. and its a very strong agreement so we cant get sued. but i said, listen, they were worried theyre going to hurt people. i said, these people are terminally ill. theyre terminally ill, and so we do it now. nine months ago, all the legislators at the 49 years, so if somebodys sick, they dont have to go to asia, theyre have to go to europe. or if youre poor, you go home and you die. now what happens? very simple. you sign that document, they work it out. you wouldnt believe how many lives are being saved. its incredible. its incredible. im very proud of it, right to try. i hope you dont need it. you dont want it. you dont want it. okay? but if you do, its there.    with your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. we will enact the greatest trade deals ever made. theyll result in more products, proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, made in the usa. we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. what were doing is unbelievable. were so far ahead of everybody. what weve done in the last three years with the fda and even the speed of what were doing, it would take 12, 13, 14 years to get things approved. its down to a much smaller number, but were finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the aids epidemic in america. weve started the process. who wouldve thought that?    in 10 years, its a 10 year process, we will have ended the aids epidemic in america and it could have been been started before i came to office. it was just wasted time. we will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america. we support, protect and defend the constitution of the united states.    we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. theyre incredible, and that includes ice. you know how tough these people are? these are great patriots. they love our country. even the sheriffs alone for, some of the people that theyre dealing with. these guys walk into the golems nest and in some cases they just swing it out. they can have it. they love it. these are great. if we didnt have them, and i told you before, theyre taking out bad, bad, bad people by the thousands, especially ms13 gang members.    whos going to do that? whos going to do that? anybody in the front row? i dont know. what about you? youre a tough guy. you might do it. you could do it. i dont know. you might, yeah, you can. what you like? were going to recruit you. i think you could handle yourself. now, these are tough people, right? you got to be tough. then they get accused, theyre too tough. oh, theyre too tough. you have some of these guys. they knife people. they dont even need a gun because its more painful. they knife the two young girls, 16 years old. beautiful. they cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them. these are animals. and then nancy pelosi said, i shouldnt use the term animal.    and by the way, she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the pacific ocean and into their beaches. she ought to go and take care of her district in san. do you see whats going on? and it rains and its filth and its needles and its drugs and its, you know what. its everything and it goes right into those storm sewers. storm, not sanitary, storm and it goes right out into the pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine los angeles and san francisco, but weve just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what theyre doing.    and nancy pelosi is playing games. she ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything. san francisco was the most beautiful city. when you look at whats happened with the tents all over the place, where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat, theyre getting sick. diseases are coming back that this world hasnt seen for 30, 40, 50 years. its a disgrace. she ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense. we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. we believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy are the true american way. we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great american flag. and we live by the words of our national motto and its always going to be up there.    they want to take everything down. they dont want thomas jefferson anymore. they dont want anything. thats a terrible thing and we fight for it, now. we fight. these words will never be taken off. i dont care where i am. if im up there, if im down here, i dont know, but well be fighting. well never take these words off, in god we trust.    we stand on the shoulders of generations of michigan patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. this is the state where henry ford invented the assembly line. its the place where general motors, chrysler and kellogg transformed the nation. it gave us motown, the mustang and the might of the american midwest. this is the american mid west. and michigan is the state where generations of strong, tough and proud american workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. and we are making it bigger, better and stronger than ever before, by far.    loyal citizens like you help build this country. and together, we are taking back our country. we are returning power to you. the american people, the democrats took the people of michigan for granted, but with us, you will never be forgotten again. the forgotten men and women of this country will never, ever be forgotten again. and im fighting for you. and i love doing it with everything that i have. and i will never, ever stop. and you know that. i will say i could have a much easier life. some people say, why is he doing it? you know why im doing it because were doing the thing and look what were doing is were bringing back our country again. were respected again, were respected again. we are so respected, you dont even know how respected.    i went to nato where we were being ripped off because the other countries, you have 29 countries, and the other countries werent paying their bills. they were delinquent in real estate. i noticed people are using that word. ive been using it for the last year. its like a real estate trend. thats when they dont pay their rent, right? well, they werent paying and you have to see this chart, until i got there. they got to pay and they said, well, does that mean you wont protect us? i said, you dont want the answer to that question. over the last, and the secretary general stoltenberg, over the last period of just two years, i raised, not from us, nothing from us, $130 billion, but thats nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying $530 billion more. all of those countries.    my biggest fan in the world is secretary general stoltenberg of nato. he says, i never thought this could. im telling you, if you look, its like 15 years just down. president obama would go there, make a speech, id like to thank everybody for being here. thanks. look, great job. sayonara. goodbye. bush, they all did. nobody ever asked for money. we were spending for 100% of nato. were protecting europe. they rip us off on trade, right? they rip us off like crazy. we lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade. were changing that, but its a long time. its been going on a long time. they dont take your product. they dont take your cars. they dont take your farm product. they dont take your medical machines. we do a big business. they sell us. we dont sell them because they put restrictions. we have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesnt qualify.    its called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers. its brutal what they do. im telling you, theyre as bad as china, just smaller. they are as bad as china, just smaller and now chinas doing great. were very happy, but we have to do something with that. we have to take care of our people. we cant be ripped off by these countries, so nato is ripping us off militarily, but now theyre starting to pay big money and thats good. we want to help them. we want to be there with them, but they have to pay. they have to pay. $530 billion and the fake news doesnt even want to talk about it. they dont want to talk about it. they talk about other things. they dont want to talk about that.    when youd get a chance though, just a couple of weeks, maybe you could say over a short period of time, nato countries will be paying $530 billion more. more, not total. more. hows that?

they dont get it. they just dont get it. hello charleston, and im thrilled to be back in the great state of south carolina with thousands of hardworking american patriots who believe in faith, family, god, and country. thank you. its a phenomenal crowd, only topped by the number of people outside that didnt get in. if anybody would like to give up where youre standing or your seat, please raise your hand. all right. then lets begin, right? thank you all very much though. this is great. no, they dont get it. down the road, they have a rally for one of the people that are going to be running tomorrow. theyre trying to get to a hundred, but theyre not going to make it. so i think theyre going to set up a round table. well, thats what they do. so people want to go to a rally, they end up sitting at a round table talking about their definition of impeachment. crazy.    no, its crazy. crazy! its a crazy deal. no, the fake news media, theyve been trying to figure this out for years. they still dont get it though. they dont get it. look at all of those cameras. look at all of those cameras. thats a lot of cameras. thats a lot of cameras, lindsey and tim, thats a lot of... they heard you guys were here. they heard tim was here and that lindsey was here and that... and they said, were not going to attend that rally, but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen, theyre here, great congressmen. but this is an incredible time for our nation. were thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the great american comeback and thats what it is. jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, factories are returning, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military. our country is stronger than ever before.    we are stronger, we are better, but while we are building a great future, the radical left democrats in washington are trying to burn it all down. they have spent the last three years, and i can even go further than that, three years since the election, but we go before the election, working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy. but with your help, we have exposed the far lefts corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and lets see what happens in the coming months. lets watch. lets just watch. very dishonest people. now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? coronavirus, theyre politicizing it. we did one of the great jobs. you say, hows president trump doing? they go, oh, not good, not good. they have no clue. they dont have any clue. they cant even count their votes in iowa. they cant even count. no, they cant. they cant count their votes.    one of my people came up to me and said, mr. president, they tried to beat you on russia, russia, russia. that didnt work out too well. they couldnt do it. they tried the impeachment hoax. that was on a perfect conversation. they tried anything. they tried it over and over. theyd been doing it since you got in. its all turning. they lost. its all turning. think of it. think of it. and this is their new hoax. but we did something thats been pretty amazing. we have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. we went early, we could have had a lot more than that. were doing great. our country is doing so great. we are so unified. we are so unified. the republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. there has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. never been a movement. so a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. say usa. its okay. usa. so a number that nobody heard of, that i heard of recently and i was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. did anyone know that? 35,000, thats a lot of people. it could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000. they say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die. and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the united states. nobody. and it doesnt mean we wont and we are totally prepared. it doesnt mean we wont, but think of it. you hear 35 and 40,000 people and weve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode. cnn fake news and the camera just went off, the camera. the camera just went off. turn it back on. hey, by the way, hold it. look at this, and honestly, all events are like this. its about us. its all about us. i wish theyd take the camera, show the arena please. they never do. they never do. they never do it. they never show the arena. you can hear it because when you hear it, thats not 200 people. thats not a hundred people. thats thousands and thousands of people including people outside. you can hear it. they always show my face. see that face? they show my face. i want them to show the arena, not my face, right? how many have you been to? how many rallies have you gone?    practically every one. can you believe it? im sure your husbands are thrilled, right? theyre thrilled. where are you going tonight? im going to another trump rally. cool. number 114. what do your husbands say about that? this group up here. she said, we dont care. thank you. thank you. democrats will only say horrible things even though they know were doing a great job. were doing a great job with what we have to work with. its incredible. the democrats want us to fail so badly. even if their actions, and you take a look, hurt the people of this country, theyll hurt the people themselves, their wealth, their everything. theyre willing to hurt our country in order to say bad, even if they know its not so. we made an unbelievable deal with mexico, with canada, with china, with south korea, with japan. and if you put a microphone with these people back there like the academy awards used to be, not anymore. best movie of the year. its made in south korea. whats that all about? im waiting to see the best movie of the year-    and its made... he said, its garbage. only in south carolina can you say that. only in south carolina. youre going to get us in trouble. no, im just repeating what he said for the fake news. no, but seriously the academy awards has gone way, way down in ratings. do you know why? because they started attacking us and we dont believe in it anymore. thats why. no, but they had the best movie of the year made in south korea. they make enough stuff for us, right? and theyre good. theyre our friends. take advantage of us, thats okay. not so much anymore. we are really, you take a look, magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world. were prepared for the absolute worst. you have to be prepared for the worst, but hopefully it will all amount to very little. thats why i tell you when we have the flu with 35,000 people and this one we have to take it very, very seriously. thats what were doing. we are preparing for the worst.    my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the united states. we are ready. we are ready. totally ready. on january 31st, i ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in china from entering the united states. an action which the democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybodys complimenting me saying, thank you very much. you were 100% correct. couldve been a whole different story. but i say, so lets get this right. a virus starts in china, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesnt spread widely at all in the united states because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes, and the democrats single talking point, and you see it, is that its donald trumps fault, right? its donald trumps fault. no, just things that happened.    but you know what this does show you? things happen. whoever thought of this two weeks ago? who wouldve thought this could be going on four weeks ago? you wouldnt. but things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it. and my guys that we have the best professionals in the world, the best in the world and we are so ready. at the same time that i initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. we had a quarantine some people. they werent happy, they werent happy about it. i want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy, but after two weeks they got happy. you know who got happy? the people around them got happy. thats who got happy.    i also created a white house virus task force. its a big thing, a virus task force. i requested 2.5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need. the democrats said, thats terrible. hes doing the wrong thing. he needs eight and a half billion, not two and a half. ive never had that before. i ask for two and a half, they want to give me eight and a half, so i said, ill take it. does that make me a bad... ill take it. ill take it. i never had that before. i never had it. we want two and a half million. thats plenty. we demand you take eight and a half. he doesnt know what hes doing. we want eight and a half. these people are crazy. we must understand that border security is also health security. and youve all seen the wall has gone up like magic. its gone up like magic. you think that was an easy one? that was not an easy one. its going up great and were up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security, water, everything.    this is everything they wanted, 132 miles already. well have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime. one of the reasons the numbers are so good. we will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country. we have no choice. whether its the virus that were talking about or many other public health threats, the democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all americans. now you see it with the coronavirus, you see it. you see it with the coronavirus. you see that. when you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in, its not the only thing that comes in through the border. and were setting records now at the border. were setting records. and now just using this, so important, right? so important. im doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the united states. weve got phenomenal numbers. no, its true. the worst presidential harassment in history.    we had a great event yesterday, an event that was so beautiful, young african american leaders. one of the things i asked them, and ive been thinking about this for a long time... and great people, great people. some of them are here tonight. do you like the name african american or black? and they said, black! all at the same time. no, true. i tell you. because you say, african american or black? and they said almost immediately, black. but we had an incredible group of people and what happened is nbc... it was such a love fest. it was so incredible. it went on for 45 minutes. it was a love fest. it was incredible. nbc turned down... there they are right there. they turned down... comcast, which owns nbc... actually nbc, i think, we call it msdnc, right? msdnc. but nbc i think is worse than cnn. i actually do. and comcast, a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image... ill do everything possible to destroy their image because they are terrible. they are terrible. theyre a terrible group of people.    and they paid me a fortune for years for the apprentice. they paid me a fortune. and when i left the show, it was doing great. when i left the show, 14 seasons, think of that, they got a big movie star. i wont tell you his name. nobody would know. actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time. but the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had trump. but the country in five years from now, of course you want to upset them, five years or nine years or 13 years. or 18 years! 10 more years. nah. oh, they go crazy when you say it. when you say to them five more years, so its five, but you then say maybe nine, maybe 13, maybe 17, maybe 21, or not, maybe 21. lets do this. lets term limit ourselves at 25 years. no more than 25 years. no more. okay. theyll pass something in the senate. tim, pass it in the senate with lindsey, a 25 year term limit please.    no, were looking to do a great job. we need that extra five to get everything solidified. its like you take a tree and you plant it, it needs some time to grab on, right? and thats what we need. weve got incredible things that weve done. we have things we still can do, but we have done actually much, much more than we even promised wed do. if you think over [inaudible 00:22:07. while the extreme left has been wasting americas time with these vile hoaxes, weve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. we added another 225,000 jobs last month alone. and that makes seven million jobs since our election, seven million. the unemployment rate in the great state of south carolina. you ever hear of that place?    now sleepy joe would say, the unemployment rate in the great state of ohio... no, no. youre in south carolina. joe! joe, youre in south carolina. come up. you ever see the guy with the note, no, no, its south carolina! its not ohio. okay. then he goes, all right, iowa. did you say iowa? no. no. they did that seven times. if i did that once, it would be the end of the road, right? be the end of the road. theyd say trump has lost it. they like to say that anyway, i guess though. these people are bad people. now, sleepy joe. well, hes running tomorrow. no, but could you imagine if i said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes, which are unbelievable? every speech. i actually said the other night, i was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns. i said, thats a horrible thing. thats the end of his evening. thats the end of his political career. and then after the debate, theyre revealing him and they said, joe biden had a great night last night. i dont get it, tim. the unemployment rate here in south carolina has fallen to 2.3%, the lowest rate in your states history. the lowest rate in all of america. its the lowest rate in all of america. i said to a friend of mine, a democrat, hows the race going tomorrow? whos going to win? and he says, mr. president... no, its very interesting. he said something. this guys a real political pro too, in all fairness, even though hes a democrat. but i said, whos going to win? he said, honestly, sir, it doesnt matter. you are so far ahead in south carolina that its meaningless. meaningless. thats what they say. and in north carolina too. in north carolina.    weve destroyed the isis territorial caliphate. we killed the founder and leader of isis, al baghdadi is dead. hes dead! hes dead! and we recently took out the worlds top terrorist, qasem soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. but as we keep on winning washington, democrats keep on losing their minds. theyve gone crazy. i mean nervous nancy, crying chuck schumer, crying [inaudible 00:25:57], bunch of losers. the good citizens of south carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the democrat candidates. whether its this character that nobody ever heard of him. id never heard it. i thought i knew all the wealthy people. this guy tom, mr. impeachment, how did that work out, tom hey, he spent millions and millions of dollars in iowa, right? millions. he got less than 1%. he got one third of 1%. i wrote a little note. did you see it? it said, tom, its not so easy doing what i did. is it? not so easy. not so easy.    all you have to do is ask mini mike. hes in there for a fortune. he wished he never started. mini mike, he wished he never started. he said, well, trump can do it. im going to do it too. unfortunately its not working out too well. was that the worst debate performance in history? they had a big audience. everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what were supposed to be doing up here. he turned out to be a total catastrophe. 35 million people, can you believe that? thats a big audience. very big. and what a killer. but this guy steyer, he spends all this money. hes not that wealthy. he spends all of this money and you shouldnt waste your vote on him tomorrow. i have to be honest. by the way, are the republicans allowed to vote anyway even though... are you ready? you ready? lets do it together. i assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint, i assume. lindsey, tim, our great congressmen, are we allowed to do this? so am i allowed to request... first we-    congressman, are we allowed to do this? am i allowed to request ... first, we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against president trump. and then if its legal, i always say if its permissible by law, because they have so many little booby traps, but they only like getting the republicans. democrats skirt, right? but well see what happens about that. the democrats. but let me ask you this. lindsey, tim, youre pros. these are two of the greatest guys i know. so let me ask you this.    so i dont know what the record attendance is in this arena, but i was told that we broke it by a lot. and you got the people outside. are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for? because youre allowed to skip. all right, so wait a minute, lets do a poll. we do this for the fake news back there. ready? who would be the best candidate for us? not for them. were ready. ready? so lets go through them just quickly. we wont include steyer because hes a loser. hes out, okay? we wont include him. who would be the best? this is a real poll. this isnt one of those fake polls taken by ... in all fairness, i love you, fox, taken by fox, the worst pollster. this guy ... this pollster hates trumps guts. i was losing the last election by a fortune. they said, he did great with women. everything was wrong. and they never replaced this guy. but watch this. you ready?    so first well go ... lets say sleepy joe, right? right? then well go crazy bernie. then well go mini mike. i think hes out of it. should we include mini mike or not? mini mike is gone. mini mike is gone. i think hes gone. he doesnt have a chance. so lets not talk ... and hes not in your election anyways, so lets forget. so mini mike, i hear mini mike, by the way, has left. hes basically given up. thats what i hear. he gave up. he gave up. now, i hope what i just said keeps him in. you know, hes the kind of a guy, hell stay in because, i dont want to be wrong. mike, its time to go home. go home, mike, and enjoy your life. go home and spend some money on something.    so lets just go ... okay. do you agree well go for the two ... look, pocahontas, we can forget about her, right? pocahontas. i came out with that name far too early because those burning embers they got ... [inaudible 00:30:54] horrible to people. they said, shes not dumb, but shes just damn mean. we cant vote for her. shes a mean one. she is mean. so pocahontas, should we leave her in or out?    how about klobuchar? not going to happen. so really were down to two candidates, right? sleepy joe biden and crazy bernie. so this is a poll. i guarantee you this. as much as they hate me, they hate me. theyre going to put this all over the place. we have a poll of like 30,000 people inside and out. theyre doing it outside, too. we have a poll. are you ready?    who do i ... so in other words, whos the weaker of the two? im not interested in who does better. no, no. im not interested ... wait. ready? in other words, who do i want to run against? meaning ... very simple. we put it into nice, simple language. who the hell is easier to beat? so who is easier for us? not me. for us to beat. ready? crazy bernie? or sleepy joe? i dont know. i think maybe a crazy bernie has it a little bit. once more just quick. ready?    he said, it doesnt matter, youll beat them all.    i hope so. i hope so. so who is easier to beat, crazy bernie or sleepy joe? they think bernies easier to beat. they think bernies easier to beat. so whether its bernie sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, elizabeth warrens plan. i told you that i had more indian blood in me than her, even though i have none. i have none. zero. i have none. i have none. i said i have more indian blood in me than she has. and she choked. she said, im going to show. im going to show. she hired this company and they went out and did a blood test. 1,024th, right? so that means i probably one somewhere down the line a million years ago.    im telling you, that was horrible. she choked. we dont want a person to win that chokes. we dont want to choke artist, right? one thing you will say about me, im not a choker. with all these people for years, theyre after me years. we cant have chokers. we cant have chokers as your president. so elizabeth warrens plan to eliminate americas borders. thats what she would ... or mini mikes plan to eliminate your second amendment and take away your guns. how about that? mini mike wants to take away your guns. the insanity of the democrat party is why millions of registered democrat voters are joining our movement. they are joining our great new republican party. this november, we are going to take back the house. we are going to hold the senate, and we are going to keep the white house.    i wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people. seriously. i wonder what they say. they never talk about it. theyll say, joe biden had a fabulous crowd today. fabulous. so fabulous that theres like five people. and theyll leave and theyll say, president trump had a smattering of applause. smattering. they use the word smattering a lot. this is not ... lets let them hear it. this is not a ... this is a big ... this is not a smattering. its not a smattering. turn the cameras. thats not a smattering. that is not a smattering.    i hate it. they say donald trump ... in india, i hate to say this to you, but ... so they actually have 129,000 seat stadium. did you see it? the place was packed, and they did better than most. they gave me credit for 100,000. that was not bad. its 129. the stadium holds 100. they had a field thats about three times ... its cricket. its the biggest stadium. and they had 129. i was with the prime minister of india, modi. great guy, loved by the people of india. and we had an amazing thing. and i went in, and heres the problem. this is a big crowd. and normally i like talking about my crowds because i get the crowds like nobody, but i just got back from 140 or 50 or 60,000 people and now im coming here. what does this place hold, 15? its hard to be enthused. you understand that?    i may never be excited again about a crowd after going to india. think of this, they have 1.5 billion people. we have 350, so were doing pretty well, ill tell you what, but i love this crowd, and i love that crowd too. tell you they have a great love for ... they have a great love. they have a great leader, and they have a great love for the people of this country. that was really a worthwhile trip. with us tonight are both of your incredible us senators. two incredible friends, two warriors. senator lindsey graham and senator tim scott, come up here. and by the way, tims incredible mother is right here in the front row. as theyre doing that, they got this big ... i was going to almost do a poll on the two of them, but were not doing that. but lindsey is a true fighter for south carolina. loves your state. and as chairman of the senate judiciary committee ... you know that, right? hes the chairman of the senate judiciary committee. so important. so important. senator graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the constitution as written. lindsey was amazing, you remember, for justice brett kavanaugh? remember how badly he ... great job, lindsey. great job, man. thank you.    senator scott is a leading superstar. hes a superstar. but he is a leader in lowering healthcare costs like nobody has done it. people dont know, but in the last year, prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years. and that was with no democrat help. if we had the help, we could lower it by 50%. but well get their help. one of these days, theyre going to get smart. senator scott provides world class care for our veterans. what hes done for our veterans is incredible. and bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones, including 135 right here in south carolina. thats what it is. tim scott came to my office with an idea. he said, opportunity zone. i said, tim, what the hell is that? what is it? right, tim?    and he went through a whole big thing and i said, this maybe could work, and we tried it. it is an incredible success, and what hes done for this country is incredible. its incredible. lindsey. well start with lindsey. say a few words, please. thank you.    well, that was quite a display, wasnt it? now theres a lot of love in this room. a lot of people say to me, friends of mine, theyve very successful. theyll say, how do you speak in front of 25,000 people and 10,000 people and all of this? you know why? theres such love in the room its easy. no, its true. there is such ... i explained, they dont understand it, because theyre not for doing that, but i say there is such unbelievable love in the room that its easy to do. very easy. right? its sort of easy to do. were also thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state. and some of you maybe know i liked this guy for a long time, governor henry mcmaster. come up, henry. come up, henry.    representatives joe wilson, jeff duncan, william timmons, ralph norman, tom rice, and the chairman of the south carolina republican party, drew mckissick.

[inaudible 00:47:33] thank you, fellas.    thank you very much. and wheres alan? is your son here? youre great son, attorney general? alan, thank you very much. take good care of him, okay? thank you. thank you, alan. and thanks to republicans all over america. we are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible. since my election, over 121,000 new jobs have been created right here in south carolina. weve lifted 10 million people off welfare, including 7 million off of food stamps. and thats a good thing, not a bad thing. theyre working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and theyre making much more money and it costs our country nothing. we make money, they pay taxes. its a whole different deal.    median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country. the unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years. the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any us president in recorded history. how about that one? its a good one. thats a good one. the unemployment rate among african-americans, hispanic americans and asian americans has reached record lows. black youth unemployment has reached an all time low. black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country.    for decades, democrat politicians betrayed african-americans. they forced their children into failing schools. they shipped their jobs to foreign countries. they pushed their unfair sentencing policies. you know about alice? you know alice? and they favored illegal aliens over their own constituents. you know that. thats been happening for a long time. my administration is reversing these failed policies and delivering record gains for african-americans. we are going to compete for every single vote in 2020, and we expect to win a historic share of the black vote come election day. we are supporting working families by fighting paid ... we got something that nobody thought could happen: paid family leave. reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million american families an average of $2,200 more in their pocket thanks to the republican child tax credit. republican, not democrat. we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country. for years, politicians sold you out to global special interests, enriching other countries at your expense. that ended. that ended. but i am not the president of the globe. i dont want to be the president of the world. i am the president of the united states of america.    last month, we finally ended the nafta catastrophe, and i signed the brand new us-mexico-canada agreement into law. the usmca is a tremendous, giant, beautiful victory for south carolina farmers, ranchers, manufacturers all across the state. nothing like it, what you had to go through with nafta. everybody was leaving. it was a disgrace that it was ever signed. you know it better than anybody. you had those empty hopes all over the country, all over this state. all around the world, we are demanding trade that is fair and my all time favorite word: reciprocal. reciprocal. got to be fair.    after years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. we are finally putting america first. on no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than the issue of immigration. every democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you, the american taxpayer. they want to treat illegal aliens, people that come into our country illegally, better than they want to treat our military and our veterans. not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it threatens innocent lives. i recently invited to the white house the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped, beaten, brutalized, and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in new york city.    here in charleston county, an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade. in berkeley county, officers captured a previously deported ms-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire. and he should have never been in our country. he shouldnt have been allowed.    its being built.    its being built.    by the way, just in case you havent heard, it is being built. that, you know. and theyre going to go nuts. theyre going to go nuts. they thought they got me. they said, okay. have you heard them recently? okay. hes building the wall. and you think its easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when i have a whole party and a deep state and some never-trumpers? theyre a dying breed though. the good thing, theyre on respirator. theyre on respirator. theyre on mouth to mouth resuscitation. you can do it. im not doing it. theyre on mouth to mouth resuscitation, the never-trumpers. but you think its easy. its not. but thats been built. but you know what they say now. okay. hes building the wall, but mexicos not paying for it. yes they are, actually. they are. they are. they are paying for it.    and some of the fake news knows that, but they refuse to report it, but thats okay. youll see. youll see whats going on. and i want to thank mexico because, by the way, right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border protecting our border. we have mexico protecting our border. and they only do that for trump. they dont do that for sleepy joe. they dont do that for crazy bernie. and they dont do it for mini mike, thats for sure. theyre only doing that for trump, right? 27,000 soldiers protecting our border. in this region ...    ... thousand soldiers protecting our border. in this region of the country alone last year, ice ... theyve been treated so badly, right? they are great. theyre brave. theyre tough. any men? there are tough guys in here, but anybody want to be an ice officer? its tough stuff, right? they go into those nests. they call them nest. thats where these guys get together and they knock the hell. i mean, if they have to ... i have to be very careful. i dont want to get them in trouble, because the press wants us to be very politically correct. so let me change it around. they go into a nest of ms13, and they say, oh, hello gentlemen. how are you? on occasion, they have a fight. they never lose those fights. we need people like that. hello gentleman. how are you? how many people did you kill last year? how many people did you get kill last year with a knife, because they like knives because its more painful. this is the kind of people that we were letting into our country. ice has taken them out of our country by the thousands. by the thousands.    last year, ice officers arrested 12,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape and many for a thing called murder. on wednesday we won the big case in federal court. did you see that? did you see that? we won the case unanimously. unanimously. federal appeals court, where we dont have to give money to sanctuary cities and states if they dont work with us, finally. finally. finally. why should we?    yet the democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens. they want unfettered catch and release. we have ended that program. it was not easy. we have to go through courts. everything is a court. everything is a suit. we do anything. we turn to the right, they sue us. we turn to the left, they sue us. we win. but were winning. we have 218 judges now. its good. let me just preface that by saying i know they give fair opinions. it bears no relationship to who appoints them, but i never win with an obama appointed judge ever. i dont win. no, we have great judges going onto the courts. great judges. theyre fair judges. theyre judges that truly love our constitution. its great.    theyre judges that if we feel its right, they dont want to invite the world to trespass across our borders. very simple. the democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens. you know that. youve been reading. all you have to do is pick up a paper every day. they release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities. we dont do that anymore. we wont let it happen, and now we dont have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that theyre going to want. its a whole game changer.    they dont even want to report it. i dont know. i didnt see much. they keep talking about the virus. oh, the virus. is trump doing a good job? oh, i dont think so. gee, i dont think so. chucky schumer: i dont think hes doing a good job. this guy doesnt know hes alive. oh, what bad people. republicans believe america should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans, not for criminal aliens.    thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last spring, and we have ended catch and release permanently. you know what catching release is? we catch them, we grab them. we say, could we please have your address? address? i dont know what the hell is an address? they dont have an address. could we have a number? do you have a phone? could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court. what they do is they catch him, they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives, and its one of those things in many cases, and then release. we release him into our country. we dont do that anymore. if you knew what it took ...    we catch them, and we take some information and we release them in, and we say, please report back in four years from now for your trial. about 2% come back, and theyre the ones that are the dumbest people ive ever seen. 2%. nobody comes back. its crazy, but were getting a change. it would be so easy. they call it loopholes. loopholes. that word alone, they call it loopholes. it would be so easy if we had some democrat support. we dont have any democrat support. they want open borders. they dont care about crime. border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year. we have deported record numbers of gang members. we are building the wall faster than ever, and we will soon be rebuilding more than one mile a day.    washington democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders healthcare takeover. they want to take away your healthcare. while the washington democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security. thats whats going to happen. my administration is protecting your social security, your medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice. remember when president obama would say, you can keep your doctor. you could keep your plan. 28 times. he said, you can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan. well, he lied. we should impeach him. we should impeach him for that. he lied 28 times. youll keep your doctor, keep your plan. its wonderful. great. went through the roof. were doing a great job.    we killed the individual mandate, which is the most unbelievable, horrible. its not really obamacare anymore, but were running the hulk of it and were trying to kill it entirely, and then we will put it back. youll have great health care, and preexisting conditions will be totally protected. preexisting conditions will be totally protected. were making healthcare better and much cheaper. while premiums more than doubled in the five years before i took office, we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old obamacare. think of that and better. and better.    we are stopping surprise medical billing, a disgrace. i signed an executive order imposing price transparency, because when providers are required to show their prices, which they dont have to do, but now they do, those same prices fall very, very fast. we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. theyre just as good. i always like a name brand. i mean, theres something. theres no difference. probably sometimes theyre better. weve totally transformed veterans healthcare, getting long ought va choice and va accountability passed after 50 years.    hopefully nobody in this great arena needs it, but we have passed something that they said couldnt happen: the spectacular right to try. you know what that is? if youre terminally ill, you go all over the world. if you have no money, you cant. you go home and you die. youre terminally ill. they go all over the world. if they have money, they go to asia, they go to europe. theyre searching. we have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest labs in the world, greatest technicians in the world, and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems. now, you sign a piece of paper. were not going to hold anybody liable. you get to use that drug, and the results have been unbelievable. unbelievable.    hopefully you dont need it, but now we have right to try. theyve been trying for 51 years to get that approved. 51 years, and we got it approved. i guess im good at getting things approved, arent i? those people that i brought up here where the reason too, every one of them. they were incredible. thank you. thank you. senators, congressman, they were the reasons.    we are combating the opioid epidemic. drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 32 years. we have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease, which is a big deal. kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because its so much work. they die from overwork. its just crazy. in theory, they could keep them going for a long time, but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do. weve done things that make it so much easier, and its just such an honor to be involved. also, alzheimers disease, were really making strides. its really a great thing. great thing.    were pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for americas youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. virtually every democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the very moment of birth. that is why ive asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god. the democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. the republican party is the party of the american worker, the american family, the american dream, and of course the late, great abraham lincoln.    republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. we are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. we are a big tent. we are a big party. we are the party of big ideas for the future. this is where it is. this is where it is. this is not the old republican party. this is a very inclusive party. this is a great party. republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice, including right here in south carolina. we want to give school choice to every child in america who needs it, from kindergarten to 12th grade, because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.    i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. thats a big deal. this could not have been done by anyone but the republican party. they came to me, a group of people, and they wanted criminal justice reform. i wasnt sure about the issue, but we had a lot of great republicans, very much in favor of it, including people that happen to be right here today. they were very much, and i started studying the issue, worked hard on the issue, and criminal justice reform. you saw alice johnson come out of prison. 22 years. she had another 20 years left. think of it. for a phone call. for a phone call. a great woman, but we have many people coming out that shouldnt be there for anywhere near those terms. not for those terms.    but they came to see me, a group. a group of people came. van jones, he came up. oh, thank you, sir. they needed four senators. they needed help. i called lindsey, i called everybody. i called tim, whos so great on everything. i called everybody. they needed four senators and maybe five, and they needed help with some of the ones that werent moving in the right direction. i gave it to them, and i got it, and it was not easy. we get criminal justice reform, and then i signed it. then this van jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all. they say, van jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform. i called our great first lady over. i said, darling, please take a look. its going to be so nice, because honestly, look, they couldnt have done even close without me. i got all these people together, got them done. it was impossible. previous presidents couldnt even think about it. they couldnt even think about doing it, and they tried, although i dont think they tried too hard, bur they could have never done it.    so he gets up, and he starts by saying, i want to thank the reverend al sharpton. i knew al when he was very heavy. he looked better when he was heavy. its true. hes one of the few people, he really looked better when he was heavy. he looked much better when he was heavy. ive got to tell him. i have to explain, because i know him very well. he would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president, but he cant admit it on television. but he called and he said, i want to take the reverend al sharpton, and then name after name after name of people that i never heard of. my wife said, are they going to think about you, right? are they going to think about you? i said, darling, of course. i said, hes saving me til the end, because i was by far. its true. this is true, tim. lindsay, this is true.    i said, hes saving me til the end. its going to be such an honor to be recognized, because i dont get enough publicity. i need a little bit more. he got to the end and he didnt say it, and she looked at me. she sort of smiled. i think she loved it in a certain way. but she sort of smiled. she said, thats too bad. i said, yeah, it is. then he said, i have one more thing to say. we must get out this year and fight and vote against this president of the united states. can you believe that? its true? its a true story. van jones. these are just terrible that they could ... i was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady, but ill live through it somehow.    i recognized israels true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem. we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights. 52 years. 52 years that golan heights had been fighting and fighting for it. i did it, and i did the true capital, jerusalem, right? how many presidents promise that? every president for many, many decades promised were going to do that. they never did it. i did it. we did a lot. weve invested more than $2 trillion in the united states military, including more than $150 million this year in joint base charleston, fort jackson, and paris island. we created the sixth branch of the american armed forces, the space force. we have another branch. 72 years. not for 72 years, the air force, have they done a new branch. we did the space force.    when i first said it, everybody thought i was joking. i said, im not joking. they thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies. i said, no, its all about space. in a number of years, people are going to say, i cant believe we didnt do this sooner. we need a little vision. we need a little foresight. you know what? i mentioned space force. at arenas like this, it gets one of the biggest hands, because thats where its at. thats where its going, unfortunately, or fortunately. we needed it for defense. we needed it for offense. sixth branch. 72 years. for years, we watched as your politicians apologize for america.    now you have a president who is standing up for america, and we are standing up for the people of south carolina. at stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation. i really believe that its the survival. you see these maniacs that were dealing with. they want to give away everything. we will end up being venezuela large scale version. if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for, to secure, then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in november of 2020, november 3rd to be exact. only this way can we save the america we love and drain the swamp. i never thought it was this deep.    man. i talked about a swamp. you never told me it was this bad, fellas. that swamp is bad. you got dirty cops at the top of the fbi. you got a lot of dirty people, but you also have phenomenal people in the fbi and other places, but were draining that swamp. i never knew it was going to be this dirty, and were getting a lot of help from a lot of great people. with your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. thats whats happening. think of it. from poverty to prosperity. look at some of the stories that you have over there. look at some of the incredible stories. look at tim scott. look at that incredible story. no, really. its an incredible story. lindsay will say it.    i give about 99% of the credit to tim scotts mother. i do. i guarantee you, tim, there was no games, right? there was no games in your household. it was lets go to work, right? great mother. thank you very much. thank you. together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system finally of immigration. we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with beautiful phrase, made in the usa. we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, infectious diseases like were working on right now, and ending the aids epidemic. nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years, and it should have been started before. we will end the aids epidemic. who would have thought we could have done that?    we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on mars. you have to land on moon, and then you go to mars. we will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america. we support, protect and defend the constitution of the united states. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true american way. we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great american flag, and we live by the words of our national motto, in god we trust.    from greenville to columbia and from myrtle beach to hilton head to right here in charleston, this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. its true. its true. true. we stand on the shoulders of american patriots who have crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the panama canal, lay down the railroads, revolutionized industry, liberated millions from poverty, hunger and disease, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made america the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day.    proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. we are returning power to you, the american people. with your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.    you have the best year ever on record, right? southeast, best year youve ever had, right? you have a great governor, you have two senators, great congressman, the greatest year youve ever had, but some people in south carolina are getting a little tired, im surprised to hear this, of winning. ive very surprised to hear this. some actually called in two great senators into a big meeting, a town hall, and they said, senator scott, senator lindsay graham, were tired of winning and south carolina. cant do it anymore. its too much. its too much. weve had years where we werent winning, and it was okay. we couldnt get jobs. we took it easy, but we just want you to go and see your friend, the president, and we want you to represent us. we want you to say, mr. president, south carolina is tired of winning. we dont want to win anymore. we are tired, sick, tired of winning.'    theyre going to come in and say, sir, i hate to tell you, but the people of south carolina dont want to win anymore. ill say, mr. senators, let me tell you something. south carolina does want to win. they want to win more than anybody, and were not going to change a thing, because were winning like never before. you know what? were going to keep it that way. sorry, senators. go back to south carolina, senators. go back to south carolina, because we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under god. america is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of south carolina, the best is yet to come.    the best is yet to come. the best is yet to come, because together we will make america wealthy again, we will make america strong again, we will make america proud again, we will make america safe again, and we will make america great again.    thank you, south carolina. thank you.   i want to thank you very much. north carolina, thank you very much. im thrilled to back in the great city of charlotte, where, by the way, were having our convention. i guess you heard that, right? with thousands of hardworking american patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put america first. eight months from now, were going to defeat the radical socialists. were going to win the great state of north carolina in a landslide. we won it last time, were going to win it this time by even more. and you know, eric and lara named their daughter, you know what her name is? carolina, carolina. her name is carolina for a reason.    this is an incredible time for our nation. our country is stronger than ever before. and today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. thats great. thats great. that was great. you know, our opponents were saying,  oh, maybe hes in trouble, maybe the economy ...  theyll do anything. theyll do anything. im sure they were thrilled. do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? i dont think so.    by the way, look at this. look back there, look at all of that press. look at all them. man, i dont know if sleepy joe, or bernie, i dont think they have that much press. bernie was going wild. why would i be here tonight? why would i be here? he said why would i be here tonight? we dont have the primary, weve already won the thing, you know? i was going to say the you know what thing, i held it back, because theyll say, horrible language. he used horrible language today. but were doing fantastically.    theres never been a time where the republican party was so unified as it is now. never, never. and you hear about enthusiasm for crazy bernie, and thats true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. and theres not a lot of enthusiasm for biden. i thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said hes running for the senate. i looked at the first lady, i said,  hey, hes running for the senate. and today he just said super thursday, hes looking forward to super thursday.    jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the united states military. every day, for me and for you, its promises made, promises kept. one of the most important promises i made is right to this era. you know, we look at it, its the never ending wars in the middle east. were taking our soldiers, were bringing them back home. were not law enforcement. were bringing them back home. american troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably dont want it. the job of the american military is to secure and defend our country.    two days ago, the unites states signed a deal with the taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. after years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own american citizens    and all of the things that weve done, weve wiped out the terrorists, weve done so much, and you know what? were 8,000 miles away. you got a lot of big countries surrounding afghanistan, youve got afghanistan itself. the progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. you know that. we pay a special tribute, and i know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice.    as we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to america in the first place. theyre not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. we must keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.    by the way, i have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. somebody was saying that if pocahontas, any one of them, sleepy joe, he doesnt have that, so he doesnt have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if sleepy joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. they never say that. hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. right now. spin them around.    they dont turn, they dont turn. you notice, they dont turn. but if there were some kind of trouble in a little corner, anything to make us look bad, that camera would turn like a pretzel. i used to think, you know, modern equipment it cant turn, but when we would have a protestor, and i must say, ill say it out loud, we dont have too many protesters anymore, do we? [inaudible 00:10:48]. no fun to be a protestor at a trump rally, but do we have a great time at a trump rally?    my administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect americans from the coronavirus. you know about this whole thing? horrible. including, sweeping travel restrictions. today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and theyre really working hard, and theyre working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. theyre going to have vaccines i think relatively soon. and theyre going to have something that makes you better, and thats going to actually take place we think even sooner.    so a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. we went out, were doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. were working on that very hard. we closed our borders very early. i took a lot of heat for that. remember when i closed the borders to certain areas of the world? i took a lot of heat. but there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. and were working with other countries. in all fairness, look, its a problem, were working with other countries. remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? from 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. think of it, 27,000. you lose 27,000 people to the common flu. it can be much more. one year was much higher than the 70,000 number. those people died. so when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. i didnt know that. three, four weeks ago, i was sitting there, i said, what do we lose with the regular flu? they said, about 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people. i said, nobody told me that. nobody knows that.    so i actually told the pharmaceutical companies, you have to do a little bit better job on that vaccine. really, have to do a better job on that vaccine. [inaudible 00:13:28]. last year was approximately 36,000 people died. so were working hard on it, and were going to come up with some really great solutions. in the meantime, were stopping ... only in north carolina. only in north carolina. it can only be. how many people here are from south carolina, by the way? all right, we love both places. but that was from north carolina.    but just to finish up, so weve made a lot of progress, weve really done a great job with it. were keeping our borders strong. my job is to protect the health of american patients and americans first, and thats what ill do. washington democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. but honestly, not so much anymore. everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. were actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. so we have our professionals in constant touch, im in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. but the political attacks from some of the democrats really must stop. weve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. were going to safeguard our people, the united states.    the united states is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. earlier today, when i met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. the media didnt know. nobody knew. theyve never heard this before. and we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. who knows what happened, but were going to reduce and the severity of whats happening, the duration of the virus. we discussed all of these things. we will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible.    and i have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, america is so resilient, we know what were doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. we have the greatest health system on earth. the renewal of american strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. no country is better equipped than america to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than americans.    and together, we are in the midst of the great american comeback. thats what it is. last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in january alone. that makes seven million jobs since the election. we have destroyed the isis territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of isis, al-baghdadi. he is dead. and we took out the worlds top terrorist, qasem soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, soleimani.    while the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up american citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.    tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for super tuesday, not super thursday. no, he said, super thursday. you cant do these things. can you imagine if i said super thursday? it would be over, right? i would be over. no matter how good you are at certain things, you cant, as an example, a name like sleepy joe, hes constantly naming the wrong state. its great to be in the state of ohio. no, no, no, im sorry, youre in north carolina. no, no. joe! do you ever see them run up with a sign, no, no, north carolina, joe! once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because its a disaster no matter how good youre doing. were in north carolina! its great to be in idaho! no, youre in iowa. nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, theyre a little scary.    did you see [inaudible 00:18:54]? were going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. but did you see, sleepy joe, did you see sleepy joe, where he said, last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country. 150 million! that means 50% of our country. thats a big story. 150. can you imagine trump saying that? these people would never let me live it down. we cant make even a little mistake. we cant make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. if we make a tiny mistake, its headlining. they say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say super thursday, they say georgia, hes looking forward to winning georgia tomorrow. georgias not in super tuesday!    so many mistakes! you cant do that when youre negotiating with china. cant do that when youre negotiating with these countries, can you? those mistakes would be very tremendous.    then you have mini mike. you see this guy? can you believe it? mini mike. hes being interviewed tonight on fox. can you believe it? fox. they want to be politically correct. they want to interview, they end up interviewing more democrats than republic ... i dont know whats going on with fox. but theyre interviewing this guy the night before ... mini mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. the worst in history.    nah, i got to have more. id get down real low, but i dont want to copy him. everybody saw it. everyone said, oh, they all say, oh! do that again where you get down low. but if i do that again, its a copy. its a copy! no, no. no. you never like to copy, even though youre copying yourself. you dont like to copy. you do it once. it was a big hit. but you do it once, and you sort of say, that was nice, dont do it again, because if it doesnt work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right? right? we all know. but no, hes a disaster waiting to happen. hes a mess.    no matter which democrat candidate youre talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates ... and you see whats happening, right? its being rigged against ... its sad. its being rigged against crazy bernie. crazy bernie is going to go crazy. crazy. i think crazy bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what theyre doing. i called it a long time ago. mayor pete buttigieg, buttigieg, may pete, he quit. out last night. then i hear a senator from a state were going to win, were going to win that state, but she dropped out. sounds like they made a deal. they both supported sleepy joe. you know why? they made a deal. you know why? quid pro quo, thats why. dont care. quid pro quo. quid pro quo, they made a deal. impeach them! they should be impeached! they should be impeached! quid pro quo.    but theyve embraced an extreme left wing agenda. their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. you know that. the democrat party has gone crazy. whether its bernie sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, elizabeth pocahontass plan ... by the way, shes history. shes history. i came up with that name far too early, i shouldve just waited. but it didnt matter. i thought she was making a come back. i said, wow, i just did it to her.    but you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago? they never caught on. in fact, shell probably lose the state of massachusetts to bernie. so she doesnt know what to do because youre not supposed to lose the state of massachusetts if you get in there. shes the senator. shes the senator for massachusetts, i think shes going to lose it to bernie. and miss michigan, you see whats going on over there? michigan, were leading. were leading in wisconsin. were leading in florida. were leading-    ... wisconsin, were leading in florida, were leading in south carolina, were leading in north carolina. were leading in new hampshire. were leading in the great state of florida that was one of the first ones [inaudible 00:24:19] in the last election. hey, how great was the 2016 election? one of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. and remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. this is going to be... oh, that wasnt so easy for them. i love the scene. the scene of that convention center where hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. but elizabeth warrens here to plan to eliminate our borders, or mini mikes plan to eliminate your second amendment. mike bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. dont worry about it, its not going to happen. not going to happen for him. for sleepy joe, he doesnt even know where he is, what hes doing, or what office hes running for. actually, i honestly dont think he knows what office hes running for. and it doesnt matter.    maybe he gets in, because hes a little more moderate. so maybe he gets in. but hes not going to be running it. other people are going to. theyre going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. but theyre going to be super left radical crazies. theyre going to be super left radical crazies, joes going to be in a home. hell be watching television. everything will be just fine. the insanity of washington democrats is why millions of registered democrat voters are joining our movement. they are joining our great republican party.    turn those [inaudible 00:26:25]. we have the enthusiasm in our party. no, i really mean it. i constantly hear about the enthusiasm. theyre fighting each other, they hate each other, they dont know whats going on. we have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what were doing. we know what were doing. so were thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, hes become a great friend of mine. what he did for justice kavanaugh, do you remember that?

it doesnt matter as long as you win. you know what i gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and i just took a hotel ballroom. i said, what the heck, if i win, nobody cares, if i dont. look if you win, nobody cares what room youre in. if you lose, nobody cares what room youre in. so we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, thats it, no big deal. i think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. and if we lose, im out of there, i save a hell of a lot of money.    but i never thought we were going to lose. thats on of the things they like to spread, trump felt that he wasnt going to win. oh yeah, im running because i [inaudible 00:10:30], thats not the deal. i mean its always possible that you dont win, but boy i thought we were going to win and we were getting crowds like this actually, to be honest, i think our crowds now are bigger, stronger, and even more enthusiastic. i really think theyre more enthusiastic than ever before. and then theres two set were eight months away, thats a long, its not even our, in case you havent heard, weve got it made in the primers. for us, were not even really political season and were getting crowds like this, we were all over the last couple of weeks. we like to troll. we like to go the night before one of their primers. we do a little trolling, its called we do a little trolling. bernie sanders was very upset, why would he be there? why? because i want to win, i want to keep everybody happy. thats such a good reason. honestly, when youre two months or three months out, were getting numbers that are unbelievable. colorado went, we went to iowa, every place weve gone, new hampshire. every place weve gone, just came out of south carolina, you saw that. that was an incredible [inaudible 00:35:57]. every place that weve gone, its been amazing. id also like to recognize, so important, a woman whos really helped us win north carolina in 2016, i have a feeling this year, shell even do better, because she happened to grow up here, lara trump and my son eric trump. two great people. i mean i have to say that about my son, but i know a lot of people dont like their sons that much, but lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. she knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. how are we doing, lara? how are we doing? how are we doing in the state, are we doing good?    and were doing well in pennsylvania i hear, and south carolina, i know were doing great there. also with us tonight, is a man whos really become a good friend of mine. we were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but i will tell you, and i would say if i didnt get along, i would not be here. i wouldnt do this. i think hes been tremendous. hes been a tremendous supporter and things that weve wanted to do, and fights that weve had which were so important, hes been right up, and lizzie will tell you that hes been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. probably a lot longer than that, but hes going to come up and im going to ask senator thom tillis, come on up. thom has really been incredible, hes been working everyday. and he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. thom is the champion for the people of north carolina. this november, we need everybody to go and vote for thom, hes doing great. hes doing great. i hear hes way up in the polls, hes way up in the polls. thom, say a few words.    wow. hey thats pretty good, thats pretty good, thom. lot of times we get people up and they just cant do it. they start breathing bad, they cant breathe, oh help me, like bloomberg. did you see the debate? huh? she came after him. shes mean, shes very mean. she came after him and he started chocking [inaudible 00:41:10] get me off this stage. get me off. you guys didnt tell me this was going to happen. no, that was great thom. were also honored to be joined tonight by a true american hero, a veteran of world war ii and the korean war who just turned 100 years old. his name is george washington perry, legit. george, thank you very much for being here. thank you, george. 100 years. hes 100 and he looks good. thank you, george. with the help of everyone here tonight, america has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth. since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in north carolina.    we have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any us president in recorded history, thats happening, thats happening. the unemployment rate among african americans, hispanic americans, and asian americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. very important to me, african american youth unemployment has reached an all time low. african american poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. for decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed african americans. my administration is delivering for african americans like never before. no president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and its an honor to do it. last month here in charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all americans. its called opportunity now, you know about it. were also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of $2,200 thanks to the republican child tax credit. the republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the democrats are saying, how did they do that one?    were reversing decades of calamitous trade policies and decimated manufacturing in north carolina, you know all about. its probably the number one reason running, and the deals were making, the trade deals, are unbelievable. your state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after nafta was signed, think of that. weeks ago, we finally ended the nafta catastrophe and i signed the brand new us [inaudible 00:20:57]. the usmca is a giant for north carolinas incredible farmers and factory workers. and by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. you know about the death tax, right? its called the inheritance tax. you have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. so if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, theres no tax to be paid by your children. so they dont have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it wont happen. and i always say, i know a lot of parents that dont love the children very much.    is there anybody in this room that does not love your children? please raise your hand. please raise your hand. nobody. nobody, thats because were north carolina, you love your children. but if you dont, then it doesnt matter because if you dont love your children, dont leave them a damn thing, but you dont have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great. a lot of people dont even know that, but thats a big deal or no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly betraying the american people than on the issue of immigration.    every democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens, on your tax. not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it is threatens innocent lives as just one heartbreaking example, two illegal aliens in maryland who had been previously charged with attempted murder were released, unaccountably released, and they went on to further a teenage girl beating her with a baseball bat and slashing her with a machete. the entire democratic field supports [inaudible 00:47:15] sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. right here in north carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. killing her and dumping her body into the woods. last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in north carolina, how did that happen to north carolina? deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even mur-    gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even murder. got to change it. your democrat governor, roy cooper, vetoed a bill that would save north carolina lives and ban sanctuary cities [inaudible 00:48:18]. what is he thinking? but while your super liberal governor is putting your families at risk, your republican senator thom tillis has introduced a bill allowing american victims to sue sanctuary cities for the horrible pain and [inaudible 00:49:06] suffering they inflict on our people. were building the wall. were building the wall. were building the wall. were building the wall. mexicos paying for the wall, by the way. we built 127 miles as of today, 127.    mexico is paying for the wall. the media is going to be thrilled when i explain that mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said ive had obstruction like you wouldnt believe. the entire democratic party. i could get anything. i created space force. i could do anything. i could get. lindsey and thom tillis knows. mark knows this. all of them knows this. if i wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didnt want to get it. they didnt want to do it, but now we got it, and you think thats easy? nobody else could have done this. were building it. were building our hearts away. well soon be building many, many miles a week, but were up to over 125, i guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper.    i went to border patrol, i said,  what is your wish? well, sir, wed like it to be steel and concrete. they want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything. its called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor. i said, what does the word provisor mean? they didnt know. all it means is youre not able to climb over it. it is very tough. i dont know if you saw. in a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down. thats what the no climb is. thats what the no climb is. its a no climb. its more money. its a little more expensive. thank you. who is that? what a voice. pavarotti.    so, were building the wall. its going great. so, they said, all right. hes building the wall, but mexicos not paying for it. yes, they are. youll see. youll see. you understand. some of you understand because i told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media. if you want to end sanctuary cities in north carolina and across america, then you have only one choice. you must vote republican. you have to. you have to.    thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last [inaudible 00:03:29]. weve added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes youve ever seen, catch and release. you catch them. you then say, where do you live? they dont know because look, lets face it, they dont know. i understand that. its not even to be laughed at. they dont know. where do you live? i dont know. mexico, maybe, honduras, guatemala, who knows? el salvador. where do you live? like this guy, hes a mexican. youre about as mexican as i am. look at this guy. hes as mexican as i am. look at that hat. are you mexican? are you mexican? no, youre not. are you? he is.    its like elizabeth warren. she said she was an indian. i said, i have more indian blood in me than you have, and i have none. she said, oh, this is terrible. so she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her. right? 1024th, right? one thousandths, so i was right. i probably have more in me. what a phony she is. what a phony.    washington democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders healthcare takeover. while the washington democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security. remember they used to say with me, im going to end it the first day. well, you know what, were going to soon be four years and all ive done is make it stronger. you know that. my administration is protecting your social security, your medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. youre going to have great health. we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice.    remember president obama? you can keep your doctor. you can keep your plan. 28 times. they said, impeach him. you should impeach him. 28 times he lied. 28 times on record, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. well, thats not true. it wasnt. impeach him. were making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before i took office. we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and theyre better plans. we are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, and we are trying terminate, in the supreme court of the united states, the worst healthcare in the world, and we are going to give you the best healthcare youve ever seen at a low price and again, protecting preexisting conditions. protecting preexisting conditions.    were fighting to stop surprise medical billing. you know what that is? surprise. you get all sorts of surprises. we have people that take a blood test in one place, its $26, and in another place its $2000. same blood test, maybe the cheap one is better, who knows? same blood test. its wrong. surprise medical building. bombed. out. billing.    i signed an executive order opposing price transparency thats going to be bigger than healthcare, because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. right? its a big thing. its a big thing. weve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. we have given them, and theres a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why.    to care for our amazing veterans, we passed va choice and va accountability, and nobody said it could be done. so now, instead of waiting in line for days and days, and weeks and weeks to see a doctor, you go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get all fixed up. what a great thing. its called va choice. i got it done. theyve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they havent been able to. those people over there were a great help. we have passed the spectacular right to try. you know what that is? hopefully nobody in the room needs. hopefully nobody in the room needs right to try. we are combating the opioid epidemic. drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. weve launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and alzheimers, and were pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for americas youngest patients, and breaking all records in so doing. virtually every democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the very moment of birth. how about that? that is why ive asked congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god.    then you have the governor of virginia. the baby is born. the baby is born and he says, and then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby. this is the governor of virginia. the governor of virginia. hes a beauty. you remember what he did? he wanted to dance like michael jackson and his wife stopped him. he got lucky. but the governor of virginia wanted to do that. the baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother. the doctor will now talk, and youll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives. did you ever hear of anything like this?    the democratic party is the party of high taxes, high crime, unlimited regulations, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. the republican party is the party of the american worker, the american family, the american dream, and the late great abraham lincoln. so many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight, and were doing it for school choice, so that every child who needs it, gets it. no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.    i passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. alice johnson, do we love alice johnson? this could not have been done by anyone other than the republican party.    i recognized israels true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem. we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights. our historic investments in the united states military include $200 million to a place that nobodys heard of in this audience, im sure, fort bragg. $300 million for marine corps air station cherry point. more than $500 million for marine corps air station new river.    listen to this one. no democrats going to this. they dont even want to spend money on the military. they dont like the military. theyre not going to spend money. $1.2 billion for camp lejeune. $1.2 billion. do you think that a guy like sleepy joes going to put, he doesnt know what it means. i know what i means. we have to have a strong military. we have the strongest military weve ever had. when i came in, our military was in sad shape. it was depleted, but weve rebuilt it, $2.5 trillion dollars went into our military.    for years youve watched as your politicians apologized for america. now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of north carolina and always will. [inaudible 01:01:01] is the actual survival of an our nation itself. if you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of americans who fought and died to secure, and you know what theyre securing, they are securing us, theyre securing our freedom, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november, november 3rd to be exact.    only this way can we save the america we love, and drain the washington swamp, which is by the way, much more vicious, much dirtier, much deeper than i ever thought, but we are kicking ass. with your help, we will lift billions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration, and we will continue with the great thom tillis. we will get thom tillis. thom, i dont think anybody even wants to run against you, thom, but were going to reelect thom tillis. is that right? were going to reelect thom tillis. if we dont, im going to be so angry at you. ill only come back here a few times a year.    no, thom is going to be great. thom, i think youre in great shape. i think youre in great shape. one more hand for thom tillis, please. we dont even know whos running against him. nobody wants the run.    we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more

over the last five or six years, chinas made $500-billion. 500-billion. ripped it out of the united states. and not only that, if you take a look, intellectual property theft, add that to it and add a lot of other things to it. so, somebody... excuse me. somebody had to do it. i am the chosen one. somebody had to do it. so, im taking on china. im taking it on china on trade. and you know what? were winning because were the piggy bank. were the one that all these countries, including the european union, wants to rob and takes advantage of. but id need a letter from the attorney general    so, the fake news of which many of you are members is trying to convince the public to have a recession. lets have a recession. the united states is doing phenomenally well, but one thing i have to do is economically take on china because china has been ripping us off for many years. president clinton, president bush, and president obama and others should have done this long before me. my life would be much easier... although i enjoy doing it, but my life would be much easier if i just said, let china continue to rip off the united states. all right? itd be much easier, but i cant do that. we are winning against china. theyve lost two and a half million jobs in a very short period of time. they want to make a deal. its got to be a deal thats good for the united states where they want to make it deal. probably, we will make a deal. but if i didnt do that, and im not doing... somebody said its trumps trade war. this isnt my trade war. this is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other presidents.    over the last five or six years, chinas made $500-billion. 500 billion. ripped it out of the united states. and not only that, if you take a look, intellectual property theft, add that to it and they had a lot of other things do it. so, somebody... excuse me. somebody had to do it. i am the chosen one. somebody had to do it. so, im taking it on china. im taking on china on trade. and you know what? were winning. because were the piggy bank. were the one that all these countries, including the european union, wants to rob and takes advantage. european union, $200-billion. china, more than $500-billion.    sorry. i was put here by people to do a great job and thats what im doing. and nobodys done a job like ive done. now, would china rather wait for a little more than a year and try and get sleepy joe biden to negotiate with instead of president trump? maybe, but i dont think so. you know why? theyre losing too many jobs too fast. they had the worst year in 27 years, but i think it was actually 52 or 54 years. it was the worst year theyve had in a half a century, and thats because of me. and im not proud of that. but you know what? they want to negotiate, sleepy joe doesnt have a clue. sleepy joe said, oh, chinas wonderful. well, china is wonderful for china, but im wonderful for the usa.   thank you all. thank you very much. thank you to vice president mike pence, and hello cincinnati. you know, i used to work in cincinnati, a place called swifton village. you know what that is? swifton village? it was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? look what happened. look what happened. i was watching the so-called debate last night, and i also watched the night before that was long, long television. the democrats spent more time attacking barack obama than they did attacking me practically. this morning, thats all the fake news was talking about. its all they were talking about.    that wasnt pretty. no, were doing good. its great to be back in the state that i love. i love this state. very special. very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful ohio river with the hardworking patriots of the american heartland. thank you, ohio. we love you, ohio. weve got thousands of people standing outside, and i asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? can they sit on the stairs? but ill tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. weve sold tens of thousands of tickets. and, you know what the sale price is? we keep it nice and low. we keep it nice and low. but, there never has been a movement like this. this is a movement the likes of which theyve never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country.    theyve never seen anything like this before. you came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for ... i mean, look, from wherever you came from. there were a lot of you. and, they showed up on election day. ill never forget, a wonderful congressman from tennessee. they have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, tennessee, and he was in pennsylvania with me, great state. and he said, you know, sir, ive been doing this for a long time, but ive never seen people like this show up for early voting. people that havent voted in a long time because they didnt see anybody they wanted to vote for. he said, ive never seen it. they have trump banners, and trump hats, and trump buttons. ive never seen it.    this great congressman said, i dont know, sir, but i can tell you one thing. if the rest of the country is voting like tennessee is voting, youre going to win by a lot. and, we won, and we won by a lot. we won by a lot. our nation is stronger today than ever before. the number one economy on earth. no economy is so strong. were rebuilding the awesome might of the united states military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. we took over a depleted military. its not depleted anymore, i can tell you that.    our spirit is strong. our stride is back and our stand is clear. we are finally putting america first. its about time.    weve created six million new jobs since election day. nobody wouldve thought that was possible. more than seven million americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and theyre happy. theyre happy. 123,000 more ohio workers are employed today than when i was elected. think of that number. and, right now, ohio is the most successful its ever been in the history of our country. thank you. congratulations, ohio. stand up, mike. and, you have a good governor. i want to tell you that. good job. mike.    unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for african-americans, hispanic-americans and asian-americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. while republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled democrat party is trying to tear america apart. the democrat party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. no one has paid a higher price for the far lefts destructive agenda than americans living in our nations inner cities. they have paid a dear price. do you see whats happening?    you see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and its stolen money and its wasted money and its a shame. for decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and its been total one party control of the inner cities. for a hundred years, its been one party control and look at them. we can name one after another, but i wont do that because i dont want to be controversial. we want no controversy. no controversy. the democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. total decay. the democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence.    theyve squeezed the blood out of them. left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. so many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? theyre in jail, thats where they are. republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the democrats is their support for open borders. these open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs.    its tough enough, and i want to thank, by the way, the country of mexico. theyve got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. im starting to like mexico a lot. they do a lot more for us than the democrats do, right? a lot more, a lot more. and, the numbers are way down. youll see that. way, way down. democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. they put foreign citizens before american citizens. were not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in chicago last year.    democrat mayor. democrat? you must have a democrat mayor? do you have a democrat mayor? come on, law enforcement. democrat mayor. cincinnati, do you have a democrat mayor? well, thats what happens. you see, there are thousands of people outside, and i said, i agree. we set a new record tonight at this arena, but we could get a few more on the floors, a few more up here. theyre outside where its a hundred degrees out and they werent able to let us do it. and i said, is that run by the democrats? the answer is yes. i said [inaudible 00:16:00]. so, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record.    the homicide rate in baltimore is significantly higher than el salvador, honduras, guatemala. i believe its higher than ... give me a place that you think is pretty bad. give me a place. the guy says afghanistan. i believe its higher than afghanistan in our country. think of that. i believe, well check the numbers and if were wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. itll be headlines. trump exaggerated. i do believe the rate is higher than afghanistan, yet democrats, and theyve run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. no good, no good. the conditions in nancy pelosis once great city of san francisco are deplorable. theyre deplorable. do you remember the word deplorable?    do you remember when hillary used the deplorable? she used two words. she used deplorable and irredeemable, right? and only being a politician for a few years. i said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. deplorable was not a good day for hillary. crooked hillary. she is a crooked one shes crooked. she is crooked. nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in america happen to live in the state of california. what they are doing to our beautiful california is a disgrace to our country. its a shame the world is looking at it. look at los angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. look at san francisco. look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor ... you have a governor that invites the whole world to come into california. well pay for your healthcare.    then you wonder why so many people are coming up. theyre coming up because were the hottest economic country in the world, but theyre also coming up because you have people like that governor say, come on up. well give you healthcare. come. who wouldnt come up? who wouldnt come up? how crazy is this? how crazy is this? schools, healthcare. today, ive a simple proposal for democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. thats the way we should be doing it. thats what we should be doing. by the way, you know, they keep talking about,  oh, the voters, the voters, the voters. they want all sorts of security. what about a thing called voter id? voter identification?    rob portman, please work on that, rob portman. you have a great senator. would you please start working on that? you see the response. every place i go, rob. please, rob. voter id. they give you everything they can give you except voter id and the things that matter. republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. our pledge to americas workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions americans for the jobs of tomorrow. you know whos working very hard on that? you probably never heard of her. ivanka trump. shes working very hard. she gave up a lot. she had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. shes got over, i think, now 12 million people. theyre teaching them the great companies of our country, theyre teaching people how to do it, and its an incredible thing to watch. to give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody couldve passed except us.    president obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldnt get it passed. i got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. and, the biggest beneficiary is the african-american community. biggest beneficiary. and, something which a lot of people dont talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. doubled it. our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities.    left together, i put out a six minute video detailing everything i found unacceptable about liberalism and the democrat party.    take your time. take your time.    walk away.    doctor? doctor in the house, please? okay. thank you very much. thank you very much. thank you. thank you. thank you, doctor. thank you. dont forget, its a hundred degrees in here. that persons been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. a lot of you, so i appreciate it. and you know what? theyll come back. theyll get a little something and theyll come right back because theres never been anything like this. theres never been anything, right? never been. thank you. incredible.    we established more than 300 opportunity zones in ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. nationwide, nearly eight million african-americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. every single democrat, because they vote as a block. its the only thing they do good. they stick together. their policies, no good. theyre lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. its the only thing they have. thats the only thing they have going. democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all americans. were thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders, and well start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. a lot of people choke. they choke like dogs. they cant breathe, aw. they cant breathe. this guy was running against a so-called star ...    so, thats two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, protesters, protesters. you know what happened to the second one? he looked at the guy in front of him and he said, ah, im out of here. bye. thats the way it works, thats the way it works, i guess. too bad. but, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. shes trying to win, remember? she defrauded people with her credentials. she said she was indian, and i said that i have more indian blood than she does, and i have none. im sorry.    we drove her crazy. and, we drove her crazy. thats a good thing, not a bad thing. she went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. he said,  somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an indian. or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small. which, it was. anyway, but the guy was from her group. you wouldnt be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. i came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. it was packed the day before the election and mike dewine won that election.    -and mike dewine won that election and he won it easily. mike dewine. we have a man whos running for governor of kentucky again. and hes done an incredible job. and did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? but they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. but when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. but he had no choice and they had no choice. its a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. matt bevin. hes running in november, and because i like him so much, matt get a nice big arena ready, were going to do a rally for you.    and a man whos fantastic son is here tonight who i just met, incredible. when i ran with him, he was down. i said, rob portmans down, and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. i said, what the hell did you do? and you know what he did? he does a great job. thats what he did. senator rob portman. great guy. and we have a few guys that, these are warriors. a couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning bob mueller. that was a beauty. he was sharp, wasnt he?he was sharp as a tack and steve chabot and brad wenstrup, and warren davidson and andy barr and a man named greg pence who happens to be a brother of somebody i know very well. they have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what weve done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. thank you fellas. great job.    a couple of them gave a grilling. they gave a grilling. all they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. and also the auditor of the great state of ohio, a man whose job i made much easier because you have money pouring in. you have companies pouring in. keith faber. how is it keith? the numbers are good, keith. numbers are good, right? yeah. the numbers are good.    ohio senate president, larry obhof. larry, thank you. great job. nice tie. i like larrys tie.    and you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. i hear that office and i shudder, ohio supreme court justices, sharon kennedy and judy french. thank you. please dont recuse yourself because i gave you a nice welcome, should i ever be before you. i love judges. when they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. and then they say, id like to recuse myself because 29 years ago i met donald trump. id never have been in... weve been doing very well in the courts, by the way. have you seen? weve been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. we really have.    weve now appointed 148, think of this federal judges, 148, were going to soon have within about two months, mitch mcconnell, the senate, rob portman has helped so much. listened to this: 179. percentage wise, its the second most. we will never be number one. sadly well never be number one. so percentage wise, nobodys ever seen anything like it. and thats because president obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. and i came in, i had 148 openings. youre supposed to have none. i said, how many do we have? 148. and i said, you got to be kidding. and weve all done a good job together. its been amazing, with mitch and you and everybody. its been amazing. so were going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. thats in two and a half years. and what else? two great supreme court judges. great ones.    theres only one person. i think most of you must know this. who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? tell me. ill give you a hint? he appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the united states supreme court. george washington. thats one record were not going to beat. but i appointed many more than him, so lets take it that way. many anymore.    i also want to introduce a friend of mine whos done an incredible job. shes really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the gop. shes the chair and shes my friend jane timken. and aman bob paduchik. you know bob paduchik? so bob, i had to pick campaign manager in ohio and i kept hearing from the media, you must win the state of ohio. i heard this over and over for like a year and a half. you must win ohio. you must win. so i had to pick a campaign manager and i picked a man named bob paduchik. and no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, sir, youre going to win ohio easily. i said, but bob, we just lost the head of the gop in ohio. he left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave. great support from the governor, a different governor than mike by the way, slightly. so he had to get out. so i said, we just lost. and bob said, dont worry about it, sir. youre going to win. in fact, i think you just went up.    then we lost a couple of other people. id call him. i say, bob, im worried about ohio. very worried. he said, dont worry about it, sir. i think he just went up. he kept saying, you just went up. i said to somebody, i dont know much about this guy, but boy, hes the most optimistic person ive ever met. true. he said, dont worry. we ended up winning ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. he was right. bob paduchik. bob.    and also here tonight, i dont know, did he do a good job? my son, donald jr. and kimberly. i hope he did a good job. good, i heard you did. i heard you did a great job. hes been a great help. they both have. thank you very much. thank you, kimberly. thank you very much. our shared republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro american. weve eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average american household $3,000 more to spend every single year. the previous administration tried to shut down american energy and close up, totally, close it up. american clean, beautiful coal. thats what they did. that didnt work out too well, but you had a suffer. it didnt work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until i came along. youre not suffering any longer.    the previous administration, they liked to windmills. if a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. they make noise, theyre intermittent. they kill your birds. they break down all the time. you have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. other than that, theyre quite good. you dont want one of those windmills within vision. you hear them, theyre noisy. theyve got a lot of problems.    no, were going to say with the great energy thats powering our businesses, thats creating so many jobs. and solar, you know what? well live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. but were going to stay the way we have it. weve ended the war on american energy and were putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. weve learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. were very lucky. were now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than soviet union, formerly. remember the soviet union when it was all together. the soviet union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves russia. when it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world.    then it became russia and you know what? theyve done a good job with energy and so has saudi arabia done a good job with energy. but were now bigger than russia. we are now bigger than saudi arabia by far. i withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive paris climate accord. last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? youre shipping it all over the world. to vietnam. i was in vietnam and they said, we get coal from ohio. we get coal from west virginia. its the finest coal in the world.    weve created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like ohio the united states is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. number one. anywhere in the world. were reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate ohio communities and communities in every state. the era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what theyve done to your jobs over a period of time, nafta was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. you still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now theyre getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. we have hundreds of new companies pouring into the united states. my first week in office, i withdrew the united states from one of the last administrations worst sellouts. it would have destroyed our automobile industry. it would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe thats what president obama meant when he said, you cant produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the united states, because he wouldve signed trans pacific partnership and he wouldve been right. i killed it.    and by the way, tpp, trans pacific partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to mexico. under the new usmca. thats mexico and canada. weve got to get them to vote on that because thats an incredible deal. but under the new... its going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the united states with no tax. all we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. so they got to vote, on the usmca. before i took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but america is not being pushed around anymore. do you realize that?    i got that from working in ohio for two summers. weve taken the toughest ever action to stand up to chinas trade abuse, and i just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of chinese products that come into our country. and thats on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from china, and dont let them tell you, the fact is china devalues their currency. they pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, youre not paying for those tariffs. chinas paying for those tariffs.    for the last 20 years, chinas taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now were stopping the theft of american jobs. were stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. they steal our intellectual property. i think they want to try and make a deal with us, but im not sure, because the word is, i feel they want to wait until they get... theyre praying. theyre praying. they would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the united states like theyve been doing for the last 25 years. would love to see a guy like sleepy joe biden who has no clue what the hell hes doing.    they say to sleepy joe. sir, just sign right there. oh, okay. ill sign. well be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to china. it has to stop but they understand that. president xi is good man. hes a friend of mine. he understands it. and until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of china. thats all there.    if foreign countries dont want to pay a tariff, i have a simple solution: make your product in america. come on back to the united states. come on back to ohio. theres no tariff. theres no tariff. thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. its that quality. they were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. it was mixed up. it was bad stuff and we didnt want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. but they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is united states steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and i stopped it. i put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back.    right here in ohio. nucor a great steel company, and a steel company thats doing great again, nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in marion. charter steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in cuyahoga heights, and cleveland cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that i like a lot, toledo. toledo, ohio.    this was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. they werent expanding or they werent building. were building new plants in florida, north carolina, south carolina, all over. not just ohio. on issue after issue, democrats have forgotten who it is that theyre supposed to represent. they forgot. i wonder why they forgot. the job of elected officials is to represent american citizens, the radical democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. sanctuary cities. many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they dont want them. they dont want them. theyre dangerous and not good.    here are just a few examples. in san francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. yet each time san francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. a sanctuary jurisdiction in california recently released a criminal alien from jail. the very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. but yet again, he was released back into your community. after sanctuary city in new jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in missouri for the murders of three people. in the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent americans for a single politically incorrect thought.    but they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. horrible crimes and murder. republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans, not criminal aliens.    and yes just won a big lawsuit last week. in fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. i gave him a little reprieve. we need a lot of lawyers in the white house. we get sued so much, so unfairly, but were winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. he said, id love to go to a rally. i said,  im going to a place called cincinnati, ohio. you deserve it. we just won the lawsuit on the wall. wheres pat? we just won the lawsuit on the wall. you hear that? were building the wall faster and better than ever. its time for democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. you know what you do? you catch them and then you release them and you say, would you please report back in four years from now. but only 2% come back. you know why? because theyre not the smartest. they are not the smartest. theyre the ones we dont want to have come back. only 2% show up. catch and release, we could end it immediately if the democrats caved. so what were doing is something else. were keeping them out altogether. were replacing random migraines and were replacing the lottery system. how about the lottery system? how about lotteries?    this was chuck schumer. you put the name in a basket. the country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. well, lets see. this ones a murderer. this one robbed four banks. this one, i better not say. this one, another murder. ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. think of this. do you think theyre going to put great citizens... they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. do you think those people are going into a lottery? no. and then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. the country isnt based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. its a disgrace. and how weve done this for so many years folks, how weve done this. its an immigration system thats totally broken and were going to win the house, were going to win the senate, were going to win the presidency and were going to do a merit based immigration system. merit based.    merit based immigration. and we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. we need good people. were down to 3.5% unemployment. we need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. liberal politicians want to eliminate private-    dream. liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. remember the lies from the previous administration. if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you.    were offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. always. always. virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion.    and then youll have like a governor of virginia, its not only late term abortion, its killing the baby after the baby is born. how about that? think of that. think of that. thats why ive asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god.    democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and theyre the party, frankly, of socialism.    the republican party is the party of freedom. were the party of the american worker, the american family. were the party of the american dream. im fighting for you each and every day. i had a great life. i used to get great publicity. nobody got better... i had such a great life. it was so easy. my great wife, the first lady, melania, she said, you know, youve always been a hard worker. you love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days. but i love it and you know why i love it? because were accomplishing so much. nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things were doing.    even a thing like right to try, right? right to try. theyve been trying to get that for years and years and years. thats people that are really sick, terminally ill. they couldnt get medicine. we have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. they couldnt get anything. theyd traveled to asia if they had money. they traveled to europe. theyd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. if they had no money theyd just go home. theyd die. they had no hope. for 44 years, theyve been trying to get right to try. we are so advanced in medicine. we have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we werent allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. you know why? because they didnt want this drug if it didnt work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. so i got it approved and it wasnt easy. it was complicated. the insurance companies didnt want to do it. the government didnt want to do it.    the doctors didnt want to do it. tremendous liability. but our country didnt want to do it. they said, well, if it doesnt work, were going to get sued. i say, so theyll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the united states, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. theyre terminally ill. lets try it. and you know what? its been a miracle. so many people have done so well. its great. we got it done.    when i set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, gee, thats a good idea. theyd been working in this few years. they said, thats a good idea. i said, yeah, its a good idea. how about getting you to me like in about two hours? right to try. its a great thing. but we have so many things like that. i have lists that you wouldnt even believe. i have lists that go on for pages of things weve done. weve launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. its a very unfair system. our country pays the highest prices in the world.    last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. now were going to bring it down by a lot. were going to bring it down a lot. and now... so other countries... heres an example, canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. so we have a great governor in the state of florida, ron desantis, calls me up. doing a great job. ron desantis. he was at three and he went to 70. thats a pretty good increase, right? ron desantis, a great governor. and he comes to me, he goes, you know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. its not a good situation.    he said, if i could go and buy the drugs from canada, i could save 50%. i said, do it. do it. and if you can buy them from europe, because their system... like, remember i used to scream when i was winning states and not getting the delegates that i was entitled to and id say the system is rigged? well, the drug system is rigged. its rigged. so if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from europe or from canada or from other places at a big deep discount, were doing it and were giving them the right to do it. just happened today.    and were doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but youll be seeing that over the next two weeks. with the help of your great senator, rob portman, weve taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. no, but think of that. opioid, big problem, big problem. deaths went down. opioid deaths, 22%. nobody writes that. nobody talks about that. they dont want to talk about that. good job, rob. good job. good job, mike. we passed va choice and va accountability on behalf of our great veterans. they been trying to pass va choice for four decades. they couldnt get it done. we got it done. we got it done. this is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. sometimes theyre okay. by the time they see a doctor, theyre terminally ill. and i said, you know, i have a great idea. because i not been doing that this long. you know, weve been working with this for... ive been thinking about it a lot. this was during the campaign. what a campaign that was, right? was that a campaign or what? and i came back to my people. i had experts and i said, i have a great idea. these lines for the veterans are too long. it takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. i have a great idea. lets let them go outside. go to a private doctor. well pay the bill. theyll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. well pay the bill. and i thought... i said, man, am i smart? i am the smartest guy to think of that. so i went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and i said, how do you like that idea? and they said, sir, weve known about it for about 40 years, but weve never been... i said, really? youve known about it that long? but heres the thing. we got it done. nobody else could get it done. nobody else. and accountability. you couldnt fire anybody. if they were treating our vets badly, you couldnt fire them for anything. people could steal. they could be sadistic to our vets. by the way, they wouldnt have done that in primetime to our vets. i can tell you that. they can be whatever they want. you couldnt fire them. and it was because of unions and it was because of other things. civil service. very tough. you couldnt fire anybody for almost anything. we had cases where people got... they got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldnt fire them. we got va accountability. now we say, jim, get the hell out of here. youre fired.    were rebuilding our military. and after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in... do you lima? you call it lima, right? see? you know, most people call it lima, but i know lima. but you know why? because i came here and they said, were closing this plant. i said, what kind of a plant is it? remember when i was here? in lima. and i used to say, you mean lima? they said, no, sir. its lima. thats why... because, but leah, hey look, ill be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? and i would have been in big trouble. but the good news is i dont use the teleprompter too much.    if i did, you wouldve been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. but in lima, and i said, what kind of a plant? and i said, lets go see it. during the campaign i went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and i couldnt believe the complexity, the genius. i said, wait a minute. you close this, youll never be able to open it again. you cant open this. this isnt like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. this is complicated. this is genius and youll never replace these men and women that work here. i said... and i didnt know anything at the time other than i said, youre not closing it. they took it off to list. they kept it open and now were making army tanks around the clock. were investing in the future of human space flight. americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to mars. its going to be amazing. and you know, one thing i have to say also, and were also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just mars. and mike pence is doing a great job on that. great job.    to protect americas security, i withdrew the united states from the horrible iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal.    we gave iran $150 billion. we gave iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. plane loads of cash. i wonder what they saw when those planes landed. i wonder what happened to the cash? can you believe it? one $1.8 billion we gave them in cash.    and remember what i said, iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. when i took over, iran was all over. they had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. they were all over. and now they just want to... they want a negotiated deal so badly. iran. iran. i recognized israels true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem. and just a few months ago, we recognized the golan heights. you know that. thats another one. big one for the security of israel.    also recognized the legitimate government of venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. lets see what happens there. lets see what happens. tonight we renew our resolves that america will never be a socialist country. never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country.    no matter what label they use, a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful american dream. were not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. you must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. its about you. i say it again. i say it all the time. never happened before. theres never been a movement like this. theyve had movements. they never went... they won a state. they did well in the state. we won 32 states. theres never been anything like it. theres never been anything like it.    but this movement is about your family and your future, and its about the life and the fate of your country. we begin our... hey, look, this is a good place. is this a great thing to do? we begin our campaign and were going to do great, bob. right, bob? bob, if we dont do great, youre fired, bob. youre fired.    but think of it, our ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nations future. and again, remember this, ohio is doing better today than its ever, ever, ever done before. its the best its ever done. whats going to do... a guy like a sleepy joe biden is going to come in and say, but i could do better. i could do better. he wants to go back to sleep. together we will continue unleashing the power of american enterprise so every american can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. our country has such tremendous potential. you know, weve had... the last week, weve had the highest stock market in the history of our country. that means 401ks. that means job. but theres tremendous potential to go up. we have tremendous potential to go up. with your help, we will elect a republican congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words made in the usa or made in america. either one. you can use either one. made in america, made in the us.    we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and i see what theyre doing. i see it. they show me the things were doing in our country today. theres never been anything like it. we will be ending the aids epidemic shortly in america and curing childhood cancer very shortly. we will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. just remember with the democrats, there is no second amendment. you can forget about keep and bear arms. you can forget it.    above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one america. we will never ever stop fighting. we support, protect and defend the constitution of the united states. we stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. we believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. and we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true american way.    we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic americans. and we will always live by the words of our national motto, in god we trust.    two days ago, i spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at jamestown, virginia. it was beautiful. it was incredible. i was... i must tell you, i was reminded of so many great things in our country. we have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. we are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way.    every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are americans and the future belongs to us. the future belongs to all of you. the future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country.    and with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. we are one people in one family saluting one great american flag. we all share the same home. we all share the same heart. and we all share the same love of almighty god. together, with the great and proud people of ohio, we are making america wealthy again. we are making america strong again. we are making america safe again. we are making america great again and with your vote in 2020 we will keep america great. thank you, ohio. thank you.    thank you very much. my fellow americans, my first and highest duty as president is to defend our great country and the american people. i swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation and that is exactly what i will do. all americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of george floyd. my administration is fully committed that for george and his family, justice will be served. he will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protestors to be drown out by an angry mob. the biggest victims of the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities and as their president, i will fight to keep them safe. i will fight to protect you. i am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. but in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, antifa and others.    a number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. innocent people have been savagely beaten like the young man in dallas, texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate new york, viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. small business owners have seen the dreams utterly destroyed. new yorks finest have been hit in the face with bricks, brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. a police precinct has been overrun here in the nations capitol, the lincoln memorial and the world war ii memorial have been vandalized. one of our most historic churches was set a blaze. a federal officer in california, an african american enforcement hero was shot and killed. these are not acts of peaceful protest, these are acts of domestic terror. the destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against god.    america needs creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, healing not hatred, justice not chaos. this is our and we will succeed 100% we will succeed. our country always wins. that is why i am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in america. i am mobilizing all available, federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding americans, including your second amendment rights. therefore, the following measures are going into effect immediately. first, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. we will end it now. today i have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the national guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets, mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.    if a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then i will deploy the united states military and quickly solve the problem for them. i am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capitol washington dc. what happened in this city last night was a total disgrace. as we speak, i am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism assaults and the wanton destruction of property. we are putting everybody on warning our seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. those who threatened innocent life and property will be arrested, detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. i want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.    this includes antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. one law and order and that is what it is. one law, we have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you, we will help your business and we will help your family. america is founded upon the rule of law. it is the of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life, but where there is no law, there is no opportunity, where there is no justice there is no liberty, where there is no safety there is no future. we must never give in to anger or hatred if malice or violence rains, then none of us is free. i take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country by far our greatest days lie ahead. thank you very much and now im going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. thank you very much.   wow. thank you. so where else would you like to be but a trump rally, right? [inaudible 00:02:58] hello colorado. we love colorado, most beautiful place and im thrilled to be back in colorado springs. ive spent a lot of time here over the years. beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, thats true, of the rocky mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great american patriots.    with your help this november, we are going to defeat the radical democrats and we are going to win colorado in a landslide. and youre going to help us get cory gardner across that line because hes been with us 100%. there was no waiver. hes been with us. there was no waiver with corey. we appreciate it. thank you corey. thank you.    this month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave united states marines landed on the shores of iwo jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. it was a rough one. tonight its our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the battle of iwo jima, james blaine, donald whipple and john thurman. great, great patriots, very brave people.    and tonight we also honor the life and extraordinary, really of a very extraordinary american hero, one of the last known survivors of the attack on the uss arizona at pearl harbor on december 7th, 1941. he was in the oval office just recently, a little while ago, about a year and a half ago and we just want to pay our respects. okay, you know it is, donald stratton. [inaudible 00:00:05:40]. just passed away. sadly he passed away just a few days ago. he was going to be here. passed away a few days ago, but he was great. i have a beautiful picture of him right outside and were going to honor him and his family. great, great gentlemen. so we were going to have four. we have three and we want to thank you for being here. thank you all. thank you.    because america is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation i would like to recognize the many veterans of the vietnam war and the iraq and afghanistan wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. great people, great people.    this is a truly incredible time for america. we have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. we are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. and weve rebuilt our military over the last three years. dont tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. but when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we dont worry about budgets, right? we dont worry about budgets. we had to rebuild it. it was depleted. it was in bad shape. it was old, it was tired. we have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. now we have brand new jets. we have brand new missiles and rockets. we have everything all made in the usa. in my state of the union address, i proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback. thats what were doing. our country is stronger today than ever before. after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan democrat crusades, the radical lefts attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. they have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers weve ever had today, just came out.    and i dont know if anybody watched last nights debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? mini mike didnt do well last night. i was going to send him a note saying its not easy doing what i do, is it? its not easy, mike. not easy for any of them. now, mike didnt do too well. he went way down. its all right. mini mike. how about klobuchar, did you see her? she choked. she choked. she couldnt breathe. alfred e. neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, are you accusing me of being dumb? who would make a statement like that? because thats really what he was doing, but he doesnt want to say that. no, how about that? are you saying im dumb? that was the end of her campaign in my book. you dont say that. even if its true, you dont say that. they had a crazy person on today on one of the fox shows. i tell you, fox doesnt treat us the way they used to. but we have the great sean hannity, we do, and we have laura and tucker. and we have in the morning fox and friends, steve and ainsley, and brians gotten much better, hes moving up. and we have the great lou dobbs. lou dobbs says hes the greatest president ever. the great lou dobbs. he says, lou dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, hes the greatest since reagan. then he said about six months ago, hes better than reagan. and then he said a few nights ago, hes the greatest weve ever had. i said, does that include lincoln and george washington? he said, that includes them all. thats lou dobbs. the great lou dobbs. and youve got hegseth and youve got jesse waters. how about jesse? and judge jeanine and even greg gutfeld. greg hated us, right? but now he says, look, whether i like him or not, he gets it done. its all about getting it done. were getting it done. nobodys ever done what weve done. no, but fox says, and i dont know, its different. it was different. in the old days, it was better for us. it was better for us. but its okay, well win anyway.    no, but they had this woman on. neil cavuto, doesnt treat us good. neil cavuto, hes not too good. she said, i dont like him. nobody likes him. right now... so you had, remember lest in the readies? you remember who was lest in the readies? he got fired, right? you remember, right? remember? hes gone and now neils taking his place. neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesnt like trump too much. and he put this woman on today and she said, donald trump didnt do well in the debates and he won, because she was referring to mike bloomberg, sometimes referred to as mini mike. and i said, wait a minute, i won every debate. its true. and we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. not only won them, but won by a lot. i won every debate. im just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, time magazine. i said, nobodys allowed to do that. you cant do that. were at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. they make up 90% of the story.    so where is dan scavino? where is scavino? does anyone know who dan scavino is? dan, bring me those pages up here. bring those pages up. see if you can get them. go get them. its such fake news. its so disgusting. you know what? theyd do better if they told the truth. do you agree? theyd do better. oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when im gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, theyre going to miss us.    i told the story that a month before i ran, 2016 i was thinking about it. i said to my wife, who has become a great first lady. people love here. they said its one of the greatest fields ever assembled. and i said, what the hell should i run for if they are so great? but i remember holding up the new york times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? its like, the thing was blowing in the wind. it was dead and now its successful again. but when we leave, its all of us. we leave together. were unified. this is the most unified the republican party has ever been. and when we leave, the new york times... thank you. the great dan scavino, the most powerful man in politics.    hey dan. so zuckerberg left. who is number one in the world on facebook? and im saying this in front of the fake news because if im wrong, theyre going to report me, right? who is number one in the world on facebook?    he walked in, but thats us. he walked in for... we had dinner recently just because i want them to pay taxes. i want to find out whats going on. but he walked in, hes smart, and he said, i just want to congratulate you. small dinner, a few people. he said, youre number one in the world in facebook. i said, thats nice. i said, whos number two? he said, prime minister modi of india. i said, wait a minute, wait a minute. hes got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one. but were never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for facebook, for twitter, for anything, and they still havent figured it out. they have not figured it out. but look at all that press. look at all that press.    by the way, how bad were the academy awards this year? did you see it? and the winner is a movie from south korea. what the hell was that all about? we got enough problems with south korea with trade, on top of it they give them the best movie of the year. was it good? i dont know yet. im looking for, lets get gone with the wind. can we get gone with the wind back, please? sunset boulevard. so many great movies. the winner is from south korea. i thought it was best foreign film, right? best foreign movie. no, it was the [inaudible 00:16:25]. did this ever happen before? and then you have brad pitt. i was never a big fan of his. he got upset. a little wise guy statement. a little wise guy. hes a little wise guy.    anyway, but were doing what? over here, i just showed this real quick. right? so this horrible journalist, shes a real, shes a trump hater. you know what shes worth? zero ratings. nobody watches her, but she said... she was trying to... look, bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. he choked. hes another one whos going,  oh i cant breathe. i cant breathe. dont ask me the question, please. i look at my wife, i said, lets send him a little note. its not so easy up there to do what i did, right? not so easy.    but this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, shes been with everybody. every year shes with a different group, but i wont use her name because itll make her too famous. it actually plays to their advantage. but shes third rate and shes on the lowest rated show at fox, neil cavuto. thats why. so she said, donald trump didnt get good ratings. he didnt do well in the polls. she said, he didnt do well on the debates. she said that we were defeated in the debates. well i defeated crooked hillary every time and by a lot. yeah, shes crooked as a $3 bill. i was going, whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? whatever happened? 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didnt get in trouble. can you imagine if a republican did that? they would want to bring back the death penalty, right? two standards. but i think things are happening.    i said drain the swamp, i just never knew how deep it was. we have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. and this is part of the swamp. so what happens? she said, donald trump didnt do well in the debates. now remember my answer, rosie odonnell, right? first question ive ever, and we took down the house. then the second, brett barry asked me, i had to raise the hand. im the only one, i guess that raised the hand. right? and the place went crazy because i was the only one telling the truth. okay? turns out i was the only one telling... and the people get it. but she said i didnt do well on the bench. i said, really? i won every single debate. we had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked hillary against myself. so heres one. i dont want to... im a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? a lot of them are my friends now. they werent my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. its hard to be friends when youre competing against somebody.    youre right about that. so heres donald trump, 67. the next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. all right, thats time magazine. all right, thats time. they dont like me. i dont like them either, by the way. although actually i do like the new owner. this year i got beaten out by gretta. you know gretta? last year i got beaten out... i mean, ive won it. but when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. theres nothing wrong with it, right? i mean, weve won it, but we should win it every single year, lets face it. and now they call it person of the year. they dont go out man of the year. and i know the women out there are saying, isnt that nice? but a lot of the women out there dont like it. they dont like it. we could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. i like that.    okay, heres drudge report. drudge is starting to treat me good again. he started to like me again. i like him. look, trump and ted cruz, i can say he came in second. he was a great debater. and marco came in third and a guy who i dont like much and they dont like him much in ohio either, kasich. kasich. he was way down. way down. okay, look who won? trump. heres another one. look again, a different one, time magazine. trump, 33%. ben carson, good man, he was down. marco, jed, ted. carly fiorina, a name i havent heard in a long time. what happened to carly? and ran, good poll. heres the story. look, but way up. way up. look at this. heres another one. look at this. trump 46%. i didnt make this up. heres another one. this is a different debate. i dont know. theyre all different. i won every one of them. look, trump, i just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. trump, 46%. heres another one, cnbc. well, the markets been up. theyve actually been not so bad and joe kiernan is a good guy. he is a good guy. some of the rest, i dont care for it too much. beckys like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? which is okay. trump, almost 50%. then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, im not going to give you the names. i wont tell you that i got 48.8 and jeb bush got 1.1. the rest im not going to talk about, but he hasnt been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never trumper i guess. so jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and trump 48. thats another one. oh, heres a nice one. heres a nice one. look at this. look at this. trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. trump didnt do well in the debate. see, theyre fake news.    heres another one, trump kicked ass. trump kicked ass. trump 48, number two was six. heres another one. trump 75.6, crooked hillary was 24%. this was against crooked hillary. so look at that. trump was 74.6, crooked hillary clinton was 24.1. trump was 80%, crooked hillary was 18%. and ive got this woman. you know who it is, right? nobody knows the name. im not going to mention it. but everybody knows neil cavuto. she has no credibility and neither do you, neil cavuto. heres another one. crooked hillary, and by the way, one is a fox poll, one is breitbart, one is a drudge report. one is a patch, one is syracuse.com, one is pollack opinion, alyssa goodwin. but look at these numbers. trump 92. what is it?    so im winning every poll, i beat crooked hillary. heres the one, trump 61, crooked hillary 39. okay? thats what it is. and then i turn on the damn show on fox. again, its not the same. it was much better. it really was. it was much better. i turn on fox and ive got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president. no, i did great in the debates. i became president because of the debates, because unlike mini mike, i could answer questions.    and heres the final one and i could get you another 15. these are all the ones that taken right after. people call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in time magazine, cnbc. so heres a cnbc, crooked hillary clinton, 39%. donald trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said i didnt debate well. now look, i dont mind and you can have bad debates, but i won every single debate. listened to this, then three and a half, four years later i have to listen to a person saying how we didnt do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. take it. take it. here it is.    okay, lets get back to business. now i feel good. now i feel good. shes a third rate journalist. lets go. were standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? while the extreme left has been wasting americas time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. we went through the impeachment scam. and by the way, corey was with us all the way. he didnt move. he didnt budge. he said its a lot of bull. he said its a lot of bull. but while theyre doing that stuff and were working with a cloud, were working with these people. they want to take you out. they want to change the results. they got caught spying, lets say it like it is, right? they got caught spying on our election. fake news.    hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. go ahead, show them the room. show them the room. you see, they never do it, including fox, by the way. fox is not that much better. we just got lucky because we have some... all their high rated shows are the shows that like trump, all their losers shows like cavuto are the shows that dont like trump. how is shep smith doing lately, by the way? how is shep smith? he had the lowest ratings and now cavuto took his place so thats okay. but they never show the room.    my wife, a great first lady, she goes... i say, hi honey. did you watch the debate? yeah. how did the room look? was that... because last night i think we turned away 21,000 people. we had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? or the ice rink. we had to have 15, 16,000 people. it was on fire. you all saw it. it was great. and she said to me, she said, darling, how did you do? i said, i did great. i said, did you see the arena? and she said, no, they never show the arena. you know that guy dana white at ufc? i wont tell you about him yet, but hes a brilliant guy, right? i mean, he sold his crazy fighters, i mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with fertittas, great people. but you know what? theyre always showing its full. its full. these fakers back there, they dont want people. but ill tell you what my wife said, they dont show it, but you cant imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise. look, they wont show it. they never show it and weve never had an empty seat from the day i came down the escalator, not one.    what these guys do if mr. and mrs. jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. if she said, darling, im sorry, theres nothing i can do about it, darling. i have to go to the bathroom. he said, darling, ill walk with you. the cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, there were two empty seats. trump didnt fill up the room. these are the worst people. but when i told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way.    now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where its loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. they look like a pretzel. they want to find it. theres trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. i used to think, well its the equipment, its very rigid. they cant turn it. and then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because thats dangerous in this room, to be honest. we dont have it too much. they only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and arent fighters. but if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. they bend, boom, they get. so that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. and by the way, i told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because its fake news.    while the extreme left has been wasting americas time with vial hoaxes, weve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? we added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion.    and right now since the election, we go by the election. dont forget, a lot of things happened when we won. from the day we won that beautiful november day, the most exciting night in the history of television, including ufc fights, the most exciting night, the biggest ratings in the history of television worldwide. they were watching. i have friends in paris and london. what are you doing? im watching, 3:00 in the morning, 2:00 in the morning, 5:00 in the morning, they are watching. the whole world was watching. that was the most exciting television that anybodys ever seen. even espn, some guy on espn said, this is the most exciting event ive ever seen. and all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. but since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and weve invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. and we created-    into that military that we talked about, and we created something thats very exciting. and we have our great new general. hes on the ... hes on our ... ill tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men youve ever seen. the sixth branch of the united states armed forces, the space force.    and i will be making a big decision for the space force as to where its going to be located, and i know you want it. well be making that decision toward the end of the year. i was here, i did your ... i met ... i was up at the air force academy, and i greeted those kids, they were so great. i did the commencement address. was anybody there? i did the commencement address. and the general said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? i said, does everyone else do it, president? oh, yes, sir. what he didnt say is, theyll shake 10 hands. i said, so they do ... how many do you have? sir, we have 1156 cadets. i said, you mean other people do it? yes, sir. but they dont do 1156. theyll do 30, 40. theyll take the top 10 out of the class. i said, ill do it.    i stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. true. and i shook 1156 hands. and a lot of these kids are very strong physically. in fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. did you know that? college ... think of that. the college home run derby. i said, let me see you. i want to see what you look like. he stands up, uniform, everything else. and by the way, i did something for air force, but i did something for all of the academies. if you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although theyve done well, if youre a great athlete, you cant ... we wanted to get them to go, but they didnt because they didnt want to serve five years in the military and then theyd go into the nfl or baseball.    so, i had one of the teams in. they said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. theyve been after the waiver. you know what the waiver is? that means that if youre a great athlete, you can go to the air force academy, or army, navy, the coast guard, you can go to one of our service academies. i did the rule and we got it through congress. and you dont have to serve. you go directly into the major leagues and to the nfl, and you serve your time after, when you get out. isnt that great?    and the army coach, whos a great guy ... all great guys. navy coach, army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just cant do that. now they serve their time afterwards. isnt that great? and we did it. theyve been trying to get that for so many years. but i love that group of people. i saw this guy from the home run derby, and i shook hands. oh, i shook hands. and they come up and theyre strong people. and theyre shaking, and theyre excited. theyre a little nervous, maybe. theyre meeting the president. theyre a little nervous, and theyre strong. theyve got big, strong hands, and theyre saying ... and im saying, hello. sir, thank you. man. jeez. what are you? im captain of my wrestling team, sir. i admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir.    its like ... and im trying to act like it doesnt hurt. by the end of the day, im going like ... but we did it. and then i said, wait a minute. i said, general, no other president could do that. the presidents dont do that. he said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. oh, thats great. but i love the air force academy. and you have all of the infrastructure, so youre being very strongly considered for the space command. very strongly.    and actually, i have to say this. i think i can say this, mr. senator, but the governor showed up at the plane today, your governor. democrat. no, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. thats okay, thats all right. and we are going to be making that decision, cory, when we make that decision, all right? okay.    but weve destroyed the isis territorial caliphate 100 percent. we killed the founded and leader of isis, al-baghdadi. hes dead. hes dead. and we just killed the worlds number one terrorist, qasen soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. forever and ever.    he was the king of the roadside bomb, right? when you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. they get it, and 92 percent of them were from soleimani, and then they started making them ... they had great detection. we had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasnt working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. so theyre blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. real scum, but hes gone, hes evil, hes dead, and america is respected again like never before.    but as we keep on winning, washington democrats keep on losing their minds. theyve gone nuts. thats why millions of registered democrats, voters, people that were with the democrats for a long time, theyre leaving their party to join our movement. theyre joining our great republican party. we have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. and dont believe stories, and dont believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. they give phony polls.    i got a call two weeks ago. the great state of texas. they love me and i love them. remember beto? remember? i was born for this. i was born. i said, any guy that says that, theyve got problems. well, he had problems. so hes from texas. he had a little problem, he came out against oil and gas, the bible, and guns. abraham lincoln couldnt win texas if youre against ... think of it. so hes against religion, hes against guns, and hes against oil. somehow, that doesnt play. but they had ... listen to this one, because this happened four years ago, you remember? donald trump is in trouble in texas. i dont think so. i dont think so. and then they announce at night, 8:00. the polls have closed ... and you know they only announce if youre very ... if youre really going to win by a lot. otherwise, it takes all night. the polls have closed in the great state of texas. donald trump has won the great state of texas. thank you.    but they had alfred e. newman, buttigieg, little buttigieg. i said, ive had you up to here. they had little buttigieg leading donald trump in texas. these people. but very close. they said, its too close to call, where buttigieg ... so, a friend of mine from texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real texas, hes got the cowboy hat ... id love to wear that hat, i wouldnt have to comb my hair so much. i wouldnt need hairspray, right? i love those texas hats. i dont know if wed get away with it in washington, thats my only problem, but i love them. this guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. hes a big guy. and hes interviewed by somebody. he said, listen, i dont know much about politics, but i can tell you one thing. buttigieg is not tied with the president. the president is leading him by 20 points. its like i said the last time, nobodys leading trump in texas. and you know what? nobody is even close to us in the great state of colorado. were leading big. nobody.    with your energy and enthusiasm, this november, and specifically its november 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big ... and i cant say bigger, because what was bigger than that? they came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. women would come in, they hadnt voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. no, no, incredible. and they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and theyre ... were the elite, just so you ... theyre not the elite, were the elite. and you know what? theyd show up, theyve got trump bandanas along with our great vice president mike pence, trump pence, and they got the hats now and they walk ... these are people that were never political people. they never wore a pin. now theyve got 30 pins all over their chest, theyve got the hats with the things and the trump, and nobodys ever seen anything like it.    really, its a great revolution, and were turning this country around. and im not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but i think if we dont do it, a lot of what weve done, and were going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what weve done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? they can undo it, but in four years they cant undo it, because that tree will be planted. it will be solid. theyre not going to be able to do it, so weve got to win.    and your second amendment is at stake, remember that. so this november, were going to take back the house, were going to hold the senate, and we are going to keep the white house. so were thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and i want to thank mike pence. i heard he gave a great speech. i never want it to be too good. i never want it to be too good. i said, mike, take it easy. cant be too got. mike is great. but we have secretary david bernhardt, department of interior. thank you. come on up, dave. hes great. what hes doing, by the way, hes the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. department of the interior. youre taking good care of colorado, please?

yes.    that was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. right, politicians? what a job he does, and we thank you very much, dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you.    so, i want to bring up a man whos going to win the election with us. and really, he has been so rock solid. there were stories, will he ... because were doing great in the state. were doing great. and your second amendment, you like the second amendment, its [inaudible 00:52:52]. but with cory and with me, theyre not going to play with your second amendment. not going to happen, but its ... it is under siege. you see whats happening. but somebody ... we fight together, and hes been so great. cory gardner, please come on up, please.    thank you. thats beautiful. thats true of the pipeline. a long time theyve been trying. we got it right away, and well be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. cory is a champion for the people of colorado. he loves your state. look, he loves your state. he was here, he does the tractor thing. he loves tractors, he sells a certain type. and dont worry, if theres any noise, just let them ... they wont hear us. and hes got my complete and total support and endorsement. he will never let you down.    that was quick. that was quick. she goes home to mom, and mom loves us. you know her mothers a big supporter. she said, was that you in that big stadium? im not liking it. shes going to have a lot of trouble at home with mom and dad. together were building the worlds most prosperous economy, and what weve done in the last three year they said was absolutely impossible to do. weve created nearly 180,000 new jobs right here in colorado, nobody would have thought that, including 25,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs. remember they said, you cant do manufacturing jobs anymore. really? tell me about it. unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over one half a century. the average unemployment rate, this is a beauty, for my administration is the lowest for any united states president in the history of our country. thats not a bad [inaudible 00:58:54].    the unemployment rate among african-americans, hispanic-americans, and asian-americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. and for women, 71 years, and soon youre going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. african-american and hispanic-american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. the unemployment rate for women is going ... and im telling you, within a very short period of time, youre going to see some statistics coming out on ... statistics. ive got to do it right, otherwise theyll say, whats wrong? if you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, whats wrong? statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. theyre going to be unbelievable. the best ever.    the veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low. workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in u.s. history. half a million more hispanic-americans now own a home. weve lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. think of that. think of this.    to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with tim scott great guy, great senator from south carolina, opportunity zones. jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in colorado. you know about that, right? its been amazing. opportunity zones are amazing, whats happened.    were supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million american families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the republican child tax credit. people dont know that.    our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of washington bureaucrats. we repealed the ridiculous waters of the united states rule, which was basically taking away your property. and we are taking the bureau of land management out of washington, dc. were just on it, and thank you very much secretary bernhardt. just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. he looks beautiful. when you work with him hes beautiful because he gets it done, and youre moving it and its headquarters to grand junction, colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great american west should live right here in the great american west. and we have ended the war on american energy. it was a war, and were up here and were doing it. we are right now energy independent, can you believe it? they want to use wind, wind, wind. blow wind, please. please blow. please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. you know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. its true. and i think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. do you believe this? do you believe this? and theyre all made in china and in germany. siemans.    and for those of you that want to hear it, when theyre making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. more stuff is going up there, theyre making it, ay, ay, ay. and they dont say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. lets get the hell out of here, and theyre all over the place. you look at palm springs, california. take a look. palm springs, theyre all over the place. theyre closed, theyre rotting, they look like hell.    every major democrat running for president wants to entirely eliminate american production of oil and natural gas, crushing colorados economy, destroying tens of thousands of colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. theyre doing that. look, youre going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy bernie. he seems to be leading.    mini mike, i thought he might come up, but he cant because he cant debate. he wasnt meant for the camera, do we agree?    he wasnt exactly great last night.    no, i think he lost too last night. only in colorado could somebody say that. no, youre going to probably ... it looks like bernie, doesnt it? it looks like crazy bernie. crazy bernies not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. but colorado voters will never let it happen.    were reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. america lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of nafta and chinas entrance into the wto. but under this administration, all of that is changing. the era of economic surrender is over, thank you. its over. last month, we ended the nafta catastrophe and i signed the brand new u.s-mexico-canada agreement into law. incredible deal. the usmca is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of colorado and every other state.    also, something we got that people dont talk about, if you love your children, you dont have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. if you love your children, its great, and if you dont love your children, dont worry about it. who in the hell knows. if you dont love them, dont leave that beautiful farm to your children. give it to somebody else, okay? if they dont treat you well, give dont leave them a damn thing. are you listening, donnie? are you listening, donnie? i also took ... no, it is true. thats a big deal. farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their ... people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. you couldnt do it. theyd go out ... your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. theyd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. you know what happens. and theyre good kids, and maybe theyll never be you. they cant farm like you and maybe they cant any maybe they can, maybe theyre better. but you know what? theyd go out and theyd borrow a lot of money and theyd lose the farm. the numbers are staggering. we got rid of it. no more death tax, no more inheritance tax.    and i also took the strongest ever action to confront chinas massive theft of american jobs. what theyve done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. billion. not million. 500 million would be a lot. were talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. our strategy worked. we put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. billions of dollars poured into the united states. they devalued their currency and they pumped money in. we didnt pay for it despite the fact that these guys ... they like to say they did, we didnt pay for it, and ill tell you what. china-    they like to say they did. we didnt pay for it. ill tell you what, china came to the table, and we made a deal thats great for us and hopefully its great for them. last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost american exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion.    you know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. you know that story. ive told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. secretary sonny purdue agriculture, hes done a great job. i said, whos the most? whats the biggest year? $16 billion, sir. i said, all right, make it 20. so they agreed on 20 so now were getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. were getting ready to close the deal between that and usmca. were getting ready to close it. i go over, i say, what do you have down for the farmers? theyve been great, although i have been helping you out. i gave you a lot of money. i gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. i took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it.    but i said, so tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? whats the number?  20 billion, sir. theyre going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. i said, make it 50. tell them to make it 50. so, we went to china and they were great. you know they got 1.5 billion people. you got a lot of feeding to do. i said, do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50? no, no, no, no, no, and they agreed to do it. they agreed to it.    i dont think youre going to be able to make it. you better be able to make it. i dont want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, im sorry we cant produce that much, sir. i said, our farmers will find a way. theyll go out and buy larger tractors and theyll buy some extra land. go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. no, but it is true. ive had people say, sir, they cant produce that much. i said, forget it. they will. look at them. youre a farmer. theyll figure that one out. although mike bloomberg said youll never figure it out. theyll figure it out long before him. youll figure that one out long before him. no, i know the farmers. im not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than on immigration.    every day democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. this region alone, last year ice officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ice officers, these guys are tough and theyre brave. over 2000 criminal aliens, thats ms-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. by the way, now their countries take them back. they werent taking them back, safe third agreements. they take them back. charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. we bring them back and in some cases we dont even want to bring them back. we have to put them. i dont want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? we dont want to take chances either, but well bring them back to guatemala, honduras, el salvador, mexico. we bring them back. they didnt use to take them. they said, we dont want them back. oh, okay, well keep them ourselves. we dont do that anymore.    in denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. the alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. in communities across the nation, radical, and were watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. last year, colorado democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals.    as a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. in denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. we just caught him for attempted murder. right here in colorado springs, el paso county officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. they released him straight into your community. these are the democrats. these are your democrats. democrats think that colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. republicans believe that colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans, not criminal aliens. if you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for cory, vote for trump, vote for the republican party. were getting it done.    thank you. thank you very much. thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, weve reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. you know what you do? you catch him. you say, where do you live? they dont live here. they dont have an address. where do you live? give us your address. they dont have an address. many are criminals. many are very dangerous criminals. so theyre saying, and we are building the wall. its gone up 122 miles as of yesterday.    its a serious wall. did you hear? two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and theyre pouring the concrete, and a lot of, its mexico, its very rough territory, some of it. its partially desert. we were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. so we hadnt put it in. we put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said trumps wall fell down. it was blown down. but see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. its true. we lifted it up and we held it up. when the storm went by, we had it set and its set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. can you imagine?    i said what happened in a certain area, and were doing a great job by the way, in new mexico. new mexico is going to be a great, great state for the republican party, and arizona, what were doing on the border in arizona, they want us to do it badly. but can you imagine that? a thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, its soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. these are very, very dishonest people, but you know that.    border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. its horrible whats happening, the largest amount ever recorded. weve deported record numbers of gang members, especially the ms-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. weve done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. the border is going to be very soon secured. well have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built.    washington democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy bernie sanders, 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernies healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million americans of their great private coverage that you want. while the socialist democrats are trying to destroy american healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that wont happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. were defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. remember, president obama 28 times, he said, keep your doctor. keep your plan. keep your doctor. keep your plan. keep your doctor. keep your plan. right? it was a lie. we should impeach him. we should impeach him. impeach obama. get him out of office.    no, nobody thought of that. we caught him in a lie 28 times at least. hes on record. we caught him in a lie, but nobody said lets impeach him. only these maniacs, crazy nancy pelosi, crying chuck schumer. what about the little pencil neck, right? pencil neck. hes got the worlds smallest neck. heres a guy that lied about my statement. he made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. he made up a statement. it was totally fiction. he made it up and then they tell me, youre getting ready to sue him, and they say, oh no, hes protected because he made the statement in the halls of congress. that should be worse. no, that should worse. little wise guy.    were making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before i took office. were now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and theyre better. theyre better. were protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. were fighting to stop surprise medical billing. i signed an executive order imposing price transparency. thats going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost.    we have totally transform veterans health care, including getting the long sought va choice and va accountability. so, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and theyre all set. they dont have to wait for six weeks. hes agreeing, right? good. right? you dont see those stories. you used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you dont see it because veterans choice, its amazing. our great veterans, heres a man right here. youre saying, yes. purple heart. thank you. thank you. thats great.    but its a lot different under trump, isnt it? a lot different under trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. theyve been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldnt get them done. im good at getting things approved. i have to say. but, we also got accountability where we can fire people that arent taking care of our vets. if somebody isnt doing a good job, you couldnt fire him. now you look at him, you say, get the hell out of here. youre fired.    we passed another thing. for 44 years, theyve been trying to get it passed, the spectacular right to try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, right to try. i hope that nobody in this room needs it. i hope you dont need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and were seeing amazing results. were combating the opioid epidemic. drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. we are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for americas youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing.    all of the radical democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb, right up until the very moment of birth. you know that. that is why at my state of the union, i asked congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god.    the democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. thats what it is. the republican party is the party of the american worker, the american family, the american dream, and the late great abraham lincoln. people forget that. people forget honest abe. hes the most presidential guy. ive always said i could be more presidential than anybody, but im not sure i can beat honest abe when he wears the hat. that hat is too much. its so easy to be presidential, so easy. its so much easier than doing what i have to do, but you know what id have? id have about three people in the front row.    how about sleepy joe? how about his performance? what? what? its great to be with the great people of ohio. joe, joe, youre in iowa. youre an iowa. oh, wow. he did it five times. so far, ive never done it. thank you. ive never done it. if i do it, thats a bad sign. now he does it all the time. he was in new hampshire and he said he was in vermont. its great to be in vermont. joe, youre in new hampshire. dammit. hed go up and tell him again and again. joe, what the hell is wrong with you, joe? sleepy joe. hes sleepy joe. he was sleepy a long time ago, but now hes really sleeping. but its easy to be presidential. you know that. the easiest thing you could do is presidential. never open your jacket. never. its got to be buttoned up. right? ladies and gentleman, the president of the united states. thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you very much. its so great to be with the people of colorado. thank you, everybody. good night. good night.    no, no. its so easy. its so easy, honestly. look, i did very well with the state of the union, right? they said it was one of the best. smart, smart. smart guy. we do good. were representing you. i better do good. if i didnt do good, youd dump me so fast. actually, i dont think you would dump be so fast, actually. you want to know the thing? she said, were never dumping you.    fake news cnn went up to a woman. what does it take for you to leave the president? im not leaving him. there were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, trump, and stupid cnn, they go up, what does it take for you? then he goes, look, he said one time that his people are so good, theyd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of fifth avenue. do you remember? right?  would you stay if he shot somebody? this is actually an answer, or something to the effect, would you say every shot somebody in the middle of fifth avenue? the woman looks, well, it depends why he shot him. makes sense.    depends why he shot him. but then they said, were not leaving him. were never leaving him. were in thing together, folks. we got the swamp. we got that dirty, rotten swamp. we got crooked politicians. we got a lot of bad people, but were getting them out one by one. we better be, little adam schiff, that little adam schiff. what a crooked politician. hes a corrupt politician.    talking about guys, hell lie and then the next day get caught. hell be sorry that he got caught. the next day hell walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. hes got no shame. hes got no shame. hes a liar. i think hes a sick person.    republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. you know that were the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. we are asking all americans to join our incredible movement. we are the big tent. we are the big party. we have the big ideas for the future. republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, its a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.    to uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written. thats a record. that is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. so, think of it. if theyre 40 years old, if theyre 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. as you know, and by the way, thats a record by a lot. i have the record, but theres one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. who has the percentage? do you know? george washington, 100%. but it was only 16 people. so, with 217, can you imagine that? its a record and were going up. were going up.    the democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, i have nominated and we have confirmed two great new supreme court justices, colorado zone, right? colorado. thats right. colorado zone, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh. neil gorsuch, thats right. colorado. hes a great guy, too, great guy. colorado. thats a big thing. thats another great check you have down for count. neil gorsuch.    i recognized israels true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem. they said they were going to do it for years. we recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights. our investments in the united states military include more than $300 million this year. has anyone ever heard of a place called fort carson? another place, peterson air force base, you know that. another place, the air force academy, you know that, and schriever, right, air force base schriever. schriever. was that right? schriever, right? schriever, thats a little tricky one. it took me a little while. im looking at that sucker. im saying, schriever, right. thank you. thats very nice. he saw he was having a little trouble with that one. thats tricky. you dont like to mispronounce a word. you come to a great place like this and instead of calling it fort carson, you go at fort crasson, and they say, oh, this guy doesnt know anything about us. no, a lot of money going into fort carson. its great.    for years, you watched as your politicians apologize for america. you saw that. well, id like to apologize. we dont apologize. now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of colorado. at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020, november 3rd. only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all. well get it finished. well get it finished. theyre bad people. theyre all over the place. theyre bad people.    with your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. you know that. together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. we will continue to enact great new trade deals like weve been doing. im going to india next week and were talking trade. theyve been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but i really like prime minister modi. we got to talk a little. weve got to talk a little business. theyve been hitting us hard. they give us tariffs. one of the highest in the world is india. but i hear theyre going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful.    but you know what, and the only problem with doing that, prime minister modi said, we will have 10 million people greet you. heres my problem. we have a packed house. we have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldnt get in. its going to look like peanuts from now on. ill never be satisfied with the crowd. if we have 10 million people in india, how can i be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? big deal. see, im getting spoiled. he said, build a bigger stadium. thats good. colorado, very good. but its going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the usa. that beautiful phrase.    we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. theyve made such progress, and ending the aids epidemic in america. we started a year ago. it should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. they didnt start it, but were starting it. well have it done within nine years. its a 10 year process. think of that. aids. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on mars.    you have a lot of that action happening right here. we will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. thats a big one. above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful america. we support, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. we believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true american way. we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great american flag. we live by the words of our national motto, in god we trust, from pueblo to fort collins, from denver to durango, from black forest to broomfield, from castle rock to right here in colorado springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded american patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before.    proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. we are returning power to you, the american people. with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. we are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under god. americas thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of colorado, the best is yet to come. together we will make america wealthy again. we will make america strong again. we will make america proud again. we will make america safe again, and we will make america great again. thank you people of colorado.    (music). thank you. thank you very much. hello dallas. its great to be with you tonight. thank you. i am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of texas where we just opened a beautiful new louie vuitton plant. im with the freedom loving patriots of the lone star state. i love it. there has never been a better time to be a proud texan and theres never a better time to be a proud american. there never has. never has.    i came from a small town, alvarado, texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of american manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places. ill tell you, this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1000 jobs for texas.    since my election, weve created 775,000 new jobs across your state including 70,000 texas manufacturing jobs. they said those jobs had disappeared, didnt they? huh? hey man, our country is once again living by two simple rules, buy american and hire american.    the economy is booming. our people are prospering. our country is thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before. but the more america achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy democrats become. crazy. theyre crazy. theyre crazy. at stake in this fight is their survival of american democracy itself. dont kid yourself. thats what they want. they are destroying this country but we will never let it happen. not even close. for three straight years, radical democrats have been drawing to overthrow the results of a great, great election. maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country. they want to oppose an extreme agenda. they cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box. theyre not going to win. the not even going to get ... they wont come close in 2020. they know it. they know it. theyre not going to win it. they say, lets see. whats another idea? whats another idea? how do we win this election? you know, i really dont believe anymore that they love our country. i dont believe it.    crazy nancy. think of that. that crazy nancy. she is crazy. and shifty schiff. how about this guy? he makes up my conversation, which was perfect. he makes up my conversation. he sees what i said. it doesnt play well because it was perfect. so he made up a totally false conversation with the ukrainian president and we caught him cold. everybody knew it anyway. see, we did one thing. you always have to do the unexpected. they never thought id released the conversation with the ukrainian president. i want to get him before congress and i want to see what he has to say. you know, they say he has immunity. why would you have immunity for outright fraud? why do you have immunity? why? hes a fraud. were fighting a campaign against leftist, socialist, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one way trade deals. were changing that one around very quickly.    they believe america is the worlds piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own. its not happening anymore. our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens. and you know thats whats been happening. and thats why 2016 was so important. and thats why 2020, i can never say its more important, but you know its like the roots of a tree. you plant the baby tree, its got to catch, get that extra time. well have more tax cuts. well have even ... ill tell you what, we have rebuilt our military. what weve done has never been done before.    the do nothing democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over. we are finally again, and weve been doing it now for almost three years. can you believe weve been doing this for three years? can you believe it? ive been a politician for three years. i cant believe that. i never thought id be called a politician. i dont like it. but it is what it is. but were finally again putting america first. the radical democrats want to destroy america as we know it. they want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that america is a sinful, wicked nation. you see that happening all the time. and i know it from personal experience. what they want to teach your kids, not good. they come home, mommy, daddy, this is what i learned. and youre going, oh no, dont tell me. lets get them into another school fast. they want to disarm law abiding citizens. they want to take your guns away. they want to install far left judges to shred our constitution. its not happening. they want to tear down symbols of faith and drive christians and religious believers from the public square. they want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor, muzzle, and shut down conservative voices. you know that.    if they didnt hate our country, they wouldnt be doing this to our country. they wouldnt be doing it because they know better. they know better. as an example, were building a great wall along the southern border and its going up rapidly. going up. and you know, five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until i came along and i said, were going to build a great wall because they could never get it done. then they stopped the funding. they made it almost impossible.    few people wouldve been able to do what we did, but we got it from here and we got it from there and we got it from all over the place and were building that sucker right now and its having a tremendous effect already. not easy. highest level. everything we said it would be, its moving rapidly. although the fake news back there, they dont want to talk about it. they dont want to talk about it. look at all those cameras. you believe it. look at all those red lights. dont worry. i wont say anything bad about your network because a lot of times i get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know, you see those red lights go off, off, off, off. they dont want their viewers to see it, but thats okay. im not going to say it tonight. im going to say youre legitimate media. i dont actually mean that. but you look at that. but look at all those cameras.    you know thats like the academy awards used to be before it failed. you know why it failed? you know why it failed? because they came after us. thats why it failed. it failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us. stupid. stupid people. they are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket. i love seeing it. im telling you. love it. but no matter how hard they try, they will fail because the people of texas and the people of america will never surrender our freedom to those people right there. we will stand strong for family, faith, god, and for country.    last week, a very dumb democrat candidate for president, thats the end of him in this state, pledged to revoke the tax exempt status of many churches and religious charities. by the way, that was after a few weeks ago. he said, excuse me, were going to take your guns away. that doesnt work well with me. i called him right. remember the flailing arms? nobody noticed it. i noticed it. the flailer. you remember he was flailing all over the place. i said why is this guy hot? john cornyns going to win so easily. just like ted cruz won. hes going to win no matter what happens.    but john cornyn is not talking about beto anymore because beto, in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion. those are not two good things in texas to get rid of. i will never allow the federal government to be used to punish americans for their religious beliefs. i will never allow the irs to be used as a political weapon, except in the case of myself where they use it against me. the radical left tolerates no dissent. it permits no opposition. it accepts no compromise. these people are crazy. and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the american people. first it was the russia hoax. then it was the smearing which continues, that disgraceful, disgusting smearing of a fine man, justice kavanaugh. and now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing. with nothing. they come after me, but what theyre really doing is theyre coming after the republican party and what theyre really, really doing is theyre coming after and fighting you. and we never lose. im fighting for everyone who believes in the values, traditions, and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world. and i have to say this, we are far greater now than ever before. you go back four years, you go back seven, six, eight, even you go back into another administration, you go back 10 and 12 years, where were you compared to where you are right now?    we must hold the democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption. they are corrupt people. and we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up. its going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide. todays do nothing democrats, they dont do anything. wheres the usmca? everybody wants it. the democrats even want it and crazy nancy wont let anybody vote on it. shes nuts. todays democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed. its not just like, lets win. you know, i have to say this. the republicans said, im not sure i like this because my life hasnt been this way, but the republicans play a much softer game. they really do. when all of our stars, and we have great stars, when they went to our speaker of the house at the time and they asked for subpoenas, oh, lets take it easy. lets ... okay. i mean, i get that too. she hands them out like its cookies. here. subpoena.    i heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day. doesnt like us at all. but said, ive never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas. i have people getting subpoenas i never heard of. i said, who are those people? never saw anything like it. its a disgrace what theyre doing to our country. we became, because of what they do, not the republicans and not what weve done because what theyve done and what they see. when people come to my office, which is now the oval office, which is your office too.    presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens. i hate to say it. sometimes dictators, they just dont like to go by that title. they say, sir, congratulations sir on what youve done. congratulations on what youve done. its incredible. your economy is the greatest on earth. and let me tell you it, if my crooked opponent would have won the election right now china would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world. weve gone up trillions of dollars. theyve gone down trillions of dollars, and we are so far number one, so far that theyll never catch us if we are smart right here. but the do nothing democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed. they dont want to just beat them. they dont want to just beat him. these are sick people. they want to crush these people. the anger, the hatred, and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified so schiff gets up and makes up my statement. he makes it up 100% and then he said he didnt speak to the whistle blower. no, we didnt see the whistleblower. and what about the whistleblower? the whistleblower got it all wrong. whos the whistleblower? whos the whistleblower? who is the whistleblower? we have to know. is the whistleblower a spy? and who is the ig that did this? all he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down, the transcribed version of the phone call. compare that to the whistle blowers account and you see it had nothing to do with it. so why does the ig allow a thing like this to happen to our country? why? why?    got a lot of bad people out there, but one by one were advancing. one by one. just look at the terrible foreign corruption of the bidens. i hate to talk about him. you know why? i dont think the guys got a chance. sleepy joe. i dont think hes got it. i dont see it. i dont know. ive got these great, brilliant senators over here. i have all these congressmen over here. fellows i dont think he has a chance. id like him to. id like him to. you know i thought pocahontas was gone, left in embers. you got to give her credit. those embers, they kept going, going, going. now it looks like shes doing better. but i dont think joe has a chance.    but did you see the other night where cnn, in a totally unsubstantiated statement, the president said this about you. were so sorry he said that. his son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from china. these were not the same chinese people i just dealt with. i will tell you that. but joe biden was in charge of ukraine policy while his son with absolutely no energy experience just got thrown out of the navy like a dog, was paid massive sums of money by a ukrainian energy company. you know thats called? its called a payoff, folks. he didnt no energy at all, knew nothing about energy. they hired him, paying him massive amounts of money, much more than the $50,000 a month you heard about. thats a lot. thats a lot. but much more.    joe biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape. but they dont want to show the tape. i had to put it up on my social media site. they dont want to show the tape where he was bragging. youre not going to get this money unless they get rid of ... and boom, they got rid of the prosecutor. he was investigating the son and the sons company. got rid of him. now thats what you call quid pro quo. while these charges are totally unsubstantiated. these are the fake newsers out there. and then biden flew. think of it. he goes into a tough place.    we just met such a great deal with china. just think of this. my guy said, if we could get 20 billion in agricultural product, that would be good. the most china ever did was 16 billion for our farmers. okay. were just talking about the farmers. we did banking. we did everything. but were talking about them. the most they ever did was 20 billion of product from our farmers. our great farmers. our patriot farmers. our farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by china. they never left me. so they wanted 20 in china agreed. i said, nope, no good. i want 50 billion, not 20 billion. 50. so my guys say, sir, we have a problem, sir. our farmers cannot produce that much. its true. i said, tell them to go out and get bigger tractors, right? john deere case, caterpillar, all american. only american tractors. we only buy american tractors. go out and get bigger. so now chinas agreed. theyve already started buying. hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with president xi and others in chile. thats in about four weeks.    but they give this. they said, sir, they cant produce $50 billion. i said, i want the farmers to tell me ... remember the story about winning? were going to win so much. were going into the white house. were going to tell the president, sir, we just cant stand winning. the state of texas, john cornyn and ted cruz, theyre going to come into my office. sir, we just cant stand this winning in texas anymore. its too much. we cant handle it. well, thats what i want from the farmers. i want the farmers to say. i want the farmers to say, sir, we just cant produce that much product. we cant do it, sir. and im going to say yes, you can. and theyre going to say, no, we cant. im going to say yes you can. and theyre going to go out and they get to take in 50 billion from china as opposed to 20. thats whats going to happen. thats whats going to happen.    but they were great. they stuck with us through thick and thin. now its really working out for a lot of different groups. in the meantime weve taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and chinas eaten the cost because they devalued their currency and they put money out. tens of billions of dollars. its cost us nothing. billions and billions and billions. you know what i did for the farmer? during the lean times, i gave them 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before. $28 billion altogether came out of the tariffs that i had a lot of money leftover and nobody complained.    you know our farmers didnt want that money. our farmers didnt want it. true story. everybody comes for money. countries come for ... everybody wants money, right? they all want our money. the farmers said, sir, we dont want this money. its a subsidy. we dont want it. i said, no, its not a subsidy. youre being targeted unfairly. they said, no, sir, its a subsidy. this is true. i had 35 farmers in the oval office. incredible people. they didnt want it. they said, sir, just give us a level field. so now i gave them a field thats more than level. its level like this. nice and easy. nice and easy.    but the farmers, i call them the great patriots the farmers. i never lost them. they always said, yeah, im in trouble. i got a problem. but this should have been done many, many years ago by other presidents and other leaders. and we lose for many years $500 billion a year with china and many other countries we lose billions. we lose with everybody. but thats all changing now. but we lose 500 billion, not million. 500 millions is a lot, right? we lose 500 billion. and you know what? its a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years. it was a disgrace. disgrace.    but now were taking in billions of dollars. theyve had the worst year theyve had in 27 years and were having the best year weve ever had. so thats good. thats good.    so biden flew with hunter on air force 2. they flew to china. hunter walked out of the plane, had a quick meeting, walked away with one and a half billion dollars. these characters back there said, oh, thats okay. theres no problem. can you imagine if don or eric trump or ivanka trump, whos here someplace ... right here. and by the way, our great first lady is home watching this. she said, this is the most exciting thing ive seen in a long time. youre a great first lady. doing a great job. shes doing a great job. were doing a great job. the whole country now is doing a great job.    so biden takes 1,500,000,000 and he goes on and he allows china to rip us off. remember he said a year ago? no, no, chinas good. theyve done nothing wrong. they are wonderful people. they are all wonderful people. i dont blame china, by the way. i blame our leaders for allowing this horrible, you know what and pillage. its the r word. you know what and pillage. you know what word im talking about, right? i dont want to use it because theyll say its a horrible word that trump used. so the bidens got rich while america got robbed. tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the democrat party and nobody ever pays the price with the democrats.    theyre so deep seeded. they never pay the price. they never pay. but maybe soon that will start. you know, weve had a lot of, weve had a lot of obama people and clinton people and some, to be honest with you, weve had some pretty bad republicans down deep that didnt exactly love us. but slowly theyre getting out. they have all sorts of protections. he says get rid of them. yeah, were trying. get rid of them. but their partner in the whole thing is the fake news media. thats the problem.    because the democrats and the fake news media, its a partnership. remember that. and you see it all the time, and ive never seen it to this extent. you know, when i won in the primaries and then i won the election, i was treated horribly by the media, horribly. and then when i won the election, we had the greatest night, one of the highest rated nights in the history of television all over the world. and i won. and i said, oh, the great thing. i said to ivanka, i said to the first lady, i said to anybody that would listen, i said, listen, this is so great. finally, finally, we, all of us, were going to be respected by the media. and you know what happened? they got worse. theyre worse now than they ever have been. theyre crooked as hell. theyre worse now than theyve ever been. theyre crooked.    the only message these radicals, and they are radical lefties, will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3rd, 2020. save that date. with your help, we will win back the house. we ...    with your help, we will win back the house, we will keep the senate, and we will keep the white house in numbers like they havent seen in a long, long time. joining us tonight are many terrific republican leaders, and they are terrific. and frankly, if theyre not, im not going to introduce them, okay? but we have some great leaders, and you have great leaders in texas. great leaders, and they love texas.    a friend of mine, a guy that a lot of people werent so sure, we had this unbelievable relationship. in fact, when ted cruz held a rally in washington, he said, could you come to my rally? and everybody thought, these people thought that was strange. they said to me, well, when is the fighting between these two? because we really like each other. whens the fighting going to start? right, ted? they said, when is the fighting going to start? and i said, dont worry, itll start. and when it does, its going to be vicious. and it was vicious, and now we love each other again. hes great. ted cruz. and he had a great victory against a man that spent almost $100 million dollars. thats a lot of money. spent almost $100 million, but that was a great victory. thank you, ted. another man whos currently running against somebody. i kept thinking maybe beto will jump in because hes at zero right now. we hope hes going to jump in. remember, no religion and no guns. i think thats not good.    oh, and i think hes like pretty light on oil production too. but a man and john, i have no idea who youre running against, but nobodys going to be able to beat john cornyn. hes a good man, youre good man, thank you, john. and we have a lot of congress people here. we have a woman whos fantastic, who has been a fan of ours right from the beginning, kay granger. thank you, kay. we have a man whos smart as hell and he is tough and he is mean and nasty, but he loves this state and hes only mean and nasty because he wants to defend you and me and all of the horrible things that we all go through, louie gohmert.    louie, hes a great guy, been a great friend of mine. ill tell you once we got him on board, he wouldnt leave us no matter what. and he had mueller and everybody figured out long before anybody else had it figured out, right, louie?

and lance gooden, special person, lance gooden,, thank you lance. thank you, lance. and lance was one of 60 people that stuck in there, he was unbelievable. and ron wright, thank you, ron. great job. great job. these are great people. these are great people along with republican party chairs and all of these total winners. heres one, ronna mcdaniel, ill tell you what, you know, ronna was the head of michigan. michigan hadnt been won by a republican for decades and it was tough. they all said you couldnt win michigan. i said, why? were getting these massive crowds, why? and she was in charge of michigan and i said, i want you to do me a favor. find out who this woman is. shes driving me crazy. she calls me, just one more trip, sir, one more trip. who is she? who is she? and it was ronna and we won the state of michigan, we won.    and when it came time, when it came time to picking somebody to head the rnc, republican national committee, i said, what about that woman that drove me crazy from michigan? and it was ronna and shes done a fantastic job. thank you, thank you, ronna. thank you, shes fantastic. and a great governor from your state, hes a great, great man and a friend of mine. and together with your lieutenant governor dan patrick. well you had a hurricane, two years ago now. they still keep calling me for money. sir, could you give us another? when the governor called up, dan was there, thank you for being so generous to texas, sir, the hurricane. it was a big one, it was a bad one. a lot of water dump. i think the biggest dump of water, remember kept going in and out, in and out. our coast guard saved 16,000 lives. but it kept going in and out, water, water.    and finally i get a call. i paid billions and billions of dollars to the state. like numbers, my people are driving me crazy. i get a call from the governor and dan is there. wheres dan? is he here? wheres dan? dan, dan patrick. and the two of them call me. and then i had ted cruz on my back and i had john cornyn on my back and i had the congressman calling and it was brutal, it wasnt even fair. and they said, sir, thank you for being so generous on the hurricane. they made a fortune. you made a fortune on the hurricane. thank you for being so generous, sir. sir, we want one more small request, just a small, its not much and we appreciate your listening to us. we want to build a dam in the ocean so that if we ever have another hurricane, sir, the water wont be able to come into houston and all of the areas that have came into, sir, do you think we could do it? i said, how much? its only $10 billion. $10 billion! right ted, right?    $10 billion they wanted, 10. and you know the way they sell it and its so good theyre salesman, theyre incredible salesman. they say its only 10 billion. im supposed to be happy. oh, lets see, could we give texas an extra 10 billion for some, crazy thing that may work and it may not, right? no, theyre great people. they love your state. rnc, co-chairman, tommy hicks, a real friend of ours. thank you, tommy. and our great campaign manager, the most sophisticated man with a computer youve ever seen. remember they used to say with hillary, her campaign is so sophisticated. then after she lost, they said, trumps campaign was so sophisticated. and remember she spent like six times more on this stuff than we did. you know the old days, my father taught me, if you can spend less, thats a good thing not a bad thing, right? my father said, if you can spend less. so we spent much less then hillary, crooked hillary, crooked hillary.    where are those emails, hillary? they may find those 33,000 emails. theyre looking, they may find those deleted emails. they may find them. remember the emails, 33,000 emails covering her gym and her daughters wedding, 33,000 thats a lot of emails for a wedding and working out. but brad parscale did a great job. thank you, brad, thank you. thank you, brad. and secretary of commerce, one of the legends of wall street, he was really like amazing and he is doing an incredible job, wilbur ross. thank you, wilbur. smart guy. and a friend of mine, hes another one. he was so tough. he was nasty, man. boy, he hit me during the campaign. i said, that guys ruthless. and when it was sort of over, there was nobody more gracious and i called him, i made him secretary of energy, hes done a phenomenal job. and rick perry couldnt have done a better job, truly, truly.    and hes going to be leaving at the end of the year and probably coming back here. whatever he does its going to be successful. but he spent three years with us and i want to thank you, rick, what a job you done, thank you. what a job hes done. he was also a great governor of texas that you know. in everything we do, were fighting for the faithful citizens of this country. this includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars. endless wars, they dont stop. they dont stop. they go on forever. we become policemen. we end up becoming police, were policing these countries. thats not what its about. weve spent eight trillion dollars in the middle east. thousands of american soldiers have lost their lives. tens of thousands more have been severely wounded, and in all fairness, the other side has lost millions of people. millions, millions of people, think of it.    these wars brought mass chaos, instability, destruction and death. today we choose a different path. we had tremendous success today. i dont know if youve seen it. we built in the last three years, we built the strongest military by far. and i told this story, i was embarrassed to tell it, but now ill tell, when i first got in, a general told me we couldve had a conflict with someone said, sir, we dont have ammunition. and i said, i never want to hear a president ... i just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as president of the united states, we dont have ammunition. think of how bad. now we have so much ammunition we dont know what to do with it.    and as you all know, i guess youve been watching today. i sent vice president pence and secretary of state pompeo to lead an american delegation to meet with president erdogan of turkey. they got there today and it did work. without spilling a drop of american blood, not one drop of american blood. weve all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of syria and it was unconventional what i did. i said, theyre going to have to fight a little while. sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. then people find out how tough the fighting is. these guys know right up here, these guys know, right? sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot. you got to let them fight and then you pull them apart. but it was unconventional, but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious.    and the kurds, who are our friends and turkeys our friend. but they fought, it was tougher. i mean it was nasty and you couldnt make a deal for 15, think of it, for 15 years, 20 years, they couldnt make a deal. the kurds didnt want to move. turkey didnt want to budge, and turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region. in all fairness to turkey, they were having a lot of bad, but they didnt ... now all of a sudden theyre fighting and its not fun having bullets going all over the place. and we went there and we said, we want to pause, and the kurds have been terrific. theyre going to move back a little bit. were going to keep isis all nice and locked up, okay. were going to find more of them.    and turkeys all set and president erdogan one was great and were going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that i put on the country, we put the worst, i mean, i dont think they could have economically survived, but that doesnt matter. president erdogan was a gentleman. he understood it, but without a little tough love. you know what tough love is, right? without a little tough love, they would have never made this deal. president obama lost a million people in the area, a million people, a million people.    so now were doing a five day period, were going to see if we can get it all finalized and i think it will be, i think it will be. so turkeys going to be happy. the kurds are going to be happy, isis is going to be unhappy. well deal with whoever we have to deal with, but well get it done. and its a great tribute to a lot of very talented people and thank you to vice president pence and thank you to mike pompeo. good job, good job and theyre traveling back to our country by night. theyre traveling back and theyll be back soon and well have a big conference on it. but it was a terrific thing and weve taken care of a lot of religious persecution. we added that in. a lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible.    so we have to fundamentally change our approach to homeland security as an example. in that example, nobody wouldve ever done that. you have to be a little bit different to do it that way. i took a lot of heat, even from some of our congressman, even from some of our senators, but now theyre all happy and im happy with them. im happy with them. now, i dont know what about the democrats? the democrats will say, oh, what a terrible ... anything we do the democrats will criticize. if i said, like on the china deal, we get beijing for one dollar. they would say, what a terrible deal. it just doesnt work with them. you know the wall. we spend so much time with them on the wall and i realized about two weeks ago, all i had to do is say, we will never build a wall. and they would have come through and they said, we demand that you build it. it would have been so much easier, right. would have been so much easier, ted, wouldve been so much easier. american combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world. bring our soldiers back home. bring our soldiers back home.    the same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open our borders to mass migration from these war torn and terror afflicted regions. their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with american issued visas. oh, isnt that wonderful? and by the way, the democrats want open borders. they want everybody to flow in. they want those caravans to flow in, the caravans. and they wouldnt get rid of the loopholes. but you know what? mexicos been great. mexico today had 27,000 soldiers on our border and weve stopped this horrible migration of people. and many of them are bad people. you know when countries send them up, theyre not sending their finest, okay, use your heads, theyre not sending their finest. youve got to see some of the people. but now we send them back. and by the way, ice is fantastic. theyve taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13 killers. theyve taken thousands of killers and brought them back.    and now weve made deals with guatemala and honduras and el salvador and mexico. but weve made deals now where we can bring back, there are 45,000 people waiting in mexico. but its going to be very tough for these people ever to get back. when did you ever hear that? used to have no people waiting in mexico. they just flooded. our borders are getting strong. when the wall is complete, therell be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world. my administration believes in a simple principle, the best way to keep foreign terrorists out of america is deny them, just deny them admission in the first place. its really pretty simple. and that is why i have imposed, and we had passed and we won at the united states supreme court, a travel ban on some of the worlds most dangerous countries and places.    but if democrats seize power, they would throw the floodgates wide open, wide open. we would have people coming into our country, look at whats going on in california and the people of california dont want it, they say, come into california. well give you free healthcare, free education. why wouldnt ... i may even move to california if they keep going. no, but all it does is it brings everybody in. whats wrong with these people? were rebuilding our military stronger than ever before and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid, senseless, endless wars. weve invested more than two and a half trillion dollars restoring our armed forces and all of it was built in the usa and that includes approving the construction of almost 200 f-35 fighters, stealth, stealth. and many of them are built right here, right here. you know that right, in fort worth. as we restore our security, were also restoring our prosperity. america is winning again and america is respected again. and by the way, i have to say this, so outside they have close to 30,000 people. and i wonder if i could ask the fire marshal, fill up this little area, let them in, it would be so nice. you know they have a certain max, we broke the record tonight. good place.    last month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years. seven million americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election. what a great ... one point three million children have been lifted out of poverty, think of that. and african american, hispanic american and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history. our great hispanic american population has reached a poverty level, which is a all time low in u.s. history. and after years of stagnation, wages for hispanic americans are rising fast, up nearly eight percent since my election and everybody in the fake news would have said thats absolutely impossible. medium income, think of this, median income for hispanic americans has surpassed $50,000 a year for the first time ever. with republicans in congress, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in american history. by the way, the democrats want to raise your taxes, you know. i dont mean a little bit.    i dont mean a little bit. i mean like double them up, triple them up and its still wont pay for the nonsense they want. we eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called american energy, which is very good for texas. since my election, natural gas production in texas has increased 35% and oil production has increased by 60%, six oh. and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, world. yet every major democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. i think they want to go to windmills, windmills, you know. darling, i want to watch trump speak tonight. we cant darling, the wind isnt blowing. they want windmills. in other words, they want to annihilate your texas economy. can you imagine? no more oil, no more natural.    so here we have a few people, right? no guns, no religion, no oil, no natural gas. abraham lincoln could not win texas under those circumstances. couldnt do it, couldnt do it, ted. couldnt do it, louis. abraham lincoln, honest abe, couldnt do it, louie, right? remember i used to say i can be more presidential, look. ive always said i can be more presidential than any president in history except for honest abe lincoln when hes wearing the hat. thats tough, thats tough. thats a tough one to beat. no, its much easier, being presidential is easy. all you have to do is act like a stiff, look.    ladies and gentlemen of texas, it is a great honor to be with you this evening. and the media would love it and everybody would be out of here so fast. you wouldnt have come in in the first place when you get right down to it, but democrats will never get that chance because texas will never give it to them. texas [inaudible 00:59:49]    remember the last election, they said these phonies in the back, they said, texas is in play. they said youd toss in play too. and i came here, we had rallies like this. thousands of people outside that couldnt get in. and i said, why is texas in play? they say because its voting, its suppression. they try and get your hopes down. theyre suppressed. this is just like fake news. but they said texas, they said texas is in play. ladies and gentlemen, texas is play. this is cnn, texas is in play. president trump ... and i had guys on from texas and theyre wearing cowboy hats. sid and a lot of guys. they go, i dont know about you, but i know something about texas and donald trump is not going to lose texas. i can tell you that and texas is not in play.    well, we had a lot of guys, sid, big tough guys. theyre on television. no, i dont know what youre talking about, texas is not in play. and then that great november 8th, we had that great, great night. and the polls close at 7:00 oclock and usually they have to take hours and sometimes at least even if its big, they take a half an hour. the texas polls have closed and usually if its close, it takes hours. and if its not even just like so close, it takes a long time. so they go, ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the state of texas. donald trump has won the state of texas. right, donald trump.    the polls have closed in utah, remember the guy with the shaved head, he was going to be my competition. even hillary beat him. now hes on these talk shows, knocking the hell out of me all the time. even hillary beat this guy in utah, right? hillary came in second. i came in first by a lot, but that was another one, too close to call. except, ladies and gentleman, utah, the polls have closed. donald trump has won the state of utah. [inaudible 01:02:19] and we won by a lot. we won by a lot. and we won florida and we won south carolina and we won georgia and we won north carolina and we won pennsylvania. we won a lot.    remember these phony people, there is no way to get to 270 you had to get to ... so i kept going to maine. i love maine, but maine too, you get one. its cut in half. maine too you get one. i went there four or five times because ... they got me up, the phonies, they got me up to 269, couldnt get to 270 so i went ... i won, by the way, i won maine too. i got one. but i went there and i went there a lot. thats the beautiful thing about the electoral college, you go everywhere. you dont just spend the three ... winning the popular vote would be much easier. id rather have that. id go to four states and relax. i went to 21 states.    i used to be a believer in the other, but i think winning ... its like youre a track star. youre working out for the a hundred yard dash or the mile, its a different form of training. its a different form. but we did great. they said he cannot get to 270 and they were right. we got to 306. after decades of economic surrender, i have taken historic action to confront chinas-    ... have taken historic action to confront chinas rampant trading abuses, and weve made great progress. and our relationship with china is fantastic, and great things are happening. you watch. they get it now. they get it. and a lot of good things are happening.    were replacing nafta with disastrous, i mean, its been, to me, probably ... i used to call it the worst trade deal in history. i think the world trade has been ... wto, what a real beauty, the world trade organization. thats a real beauty.    they consider china a developing nation. and because youre a developing nation, ted, right? they consider china to be a developing nation, and because theyre developing, they get tremendous ... and we wrote them letters. we dont consider them to be a developing nation. we dont consider india to be a develop... because theyre ripping us off. and we didnt win any cases at the wto, and now we just won $7.5 billion of countries that were taking taking advantage of us.    and weve won a lot of cases lately. we didnt win anything for years practically. now weve won a lot of cases. you know why? because they know ill leave if they dont treat us fairly. they know it. and then the piggy bank is gone where they all rob from.    were replacing the nafta disaster. and we have to get this crazy nancy pelosi to put this thing up for a vote. we have to get her. and the usmca is a giant victory for texas farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, workers, and oil. the democrats should pass it, overwhelmingly. they will. but nancy has to put it up for a vote. do-nothing democrats. theyre do-nothing.    nowhere is the democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration. in recent debates, did you see these debates? do you believe what im competing with? i dont know, when i had to compete with ted cruz, that was brutal. he was the national debate chamption, a story ive never told. i never did that before, right? i ran for office. all of a sudden, im supposed to be debating tomorrow night.    i said: who are these people?    the hell, i dont know all of them. i know a lot of them. i contributed to a lot of them. they used to treat me very nice when i contributed to them. not so nice when i was their opponent, that changed a lot.    but i said: let me see, i want to see, who are these people?    im going to a debate. i never debated. my whole life has been a debate, but i never debated with a podium, and this, and that.    so i said: who are they?    and we had 17 people, plus me. we had 18. it was actually not 17, it was 18. remember gilmore? nobody remembers him. but we had 18 people.    i said, who are these people? are they any good at debating? and i hired a debate coach, and he lasted for about 10 minutes.    i said: this guy knows less than i do.    he didnt know anything. he didnt know anything, its true. he said, never ever interrupt while theyre speaking.    i said: okay, coach. put me in, coach. and after a couple of those statements, i mean ... i mean, you cant beat ted cruz if you dont interrupt him. its impossible.    but my first ... its true. so i see, let me see the cards. let me see the whole thing. i want to see it. i need help. im going to be debating in front of millions of people.    and everyones saying, do you think trumps going to be able to debate professionally?    i said: let me see these cards.    and all of them: you know, he was president of his class. one guy was a good debater in college. he was this, he was okay.    but they give me the first card, ted cruz, and it says, national debate champion from princeton. is that right? and then, national debate champion from harvard.    i said to my wife, first lady, potentially, i said: my potential first lady, i got a problem.    i said: some of these guys are okay. they were only president of the class.    almost all of them ran for president of the class. i never did. i liked playing baseball better.    but i said, melania, and i called ivanka, i called my kids, i said, i got a problem. ted cruz was the national debate, he was the number one guy in college. he was the number one guy in law school. how the hell do i beat a guy thats that good at debating?    but we came out okay, ted. and ted, ted was tough. smart as hell and tough. tough. good man. but it is true. the first card i looked at, seriously, it was ted cruz. and he was literally, i mean, national debate, he was the best in all of college and in law school. and hes a talented guy.    in recent debates, you see these people up there. theyre not ted cruz, believe me. hey ted, you should turn democrat. you would win in that group [inaudible 00:01:09:44]. no, he says. i dont think so.    every single democrat candidate for president raised their hand in favor of giving free healthcare to all illegal aliens. they want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to american citizens. you see that. as president, i will never allow the democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally. cant do it.    in fact, i just signed an executive action to protect american healthcare benefits for all american citizens. among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in texas, including millions of patriotic, hardworking mexican-americans who play by the rules, pay their taxes, follow our laws, and strengthen our communities. whether you are a first-generation or tenth-generation, and every american citizen, and you do, youve been treated so badly. but youre not being treated badly anymore. you know?    we got rid of the individual mandate from crazy obamacare. every american citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, your borders, and is always loyal to you for a change. were loyal to you.    my administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since may. and thats with no help from the democrats. they wont close up the loopholes. they wont close the loopholes, and we could do it in 15 minutes. and were building the wall and were doing all of these things, but the democrats wont close up the loopholes. you know what the loopholes are, right? how about catch and release? you catch them. you say, hello, darling, how are you? could you please give us your name and phone number? they dont have a phone. could you give us your address? they dont want to have that have a phone? could you give us your address? they dont want to have an address thats in honduras. could you please give us your address and your name? they cant. they say, thats okay. we catch and we release, and they go into our country. and then we are getting them out of the country.    and you know what? some are very good people. some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people. and were focusing on the bad and theyre getting the hell out of our country. okay?    while were fighting for shared priorities, the american people, the democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream. theyve gone nuts. every democrat running for president is pushing a healthcare agenda that would utterly eviscerate medicare. my administration will always protect medicare for our beloved seniors. and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.    our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years. people dont talk about it. the press will not talk about it. we have news conferences. we tell them this, they will not put it in the press. you have no idea how dishonest the media is. you have no idea.    virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the moment of birth. and that crackpot governor from virginia executes the baby after birth. you saw that, right? after birth. you remember that one from last year. thats why ive asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god. democrats are now the party of crazy politicians, high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. theyre corrupt, like schiff is corrupt. hes corrupt.    the republican party is the party of the american worker, the american family, and its the party of the american dream. its also the party of honest abe lincoln. we forget that. we got to use that more often. dont you think? honest abe. i liked honest abe.    weve confirmed ... he says honest donald. thank you. explain that to them. youre right. weve confirmed 152 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two supreme court justices, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh.    when i got into office, they say the most important thing a president can do, i actually think its defense, but they say is the appointment of federal judges. so when i got in, always, when you get in, there are none.     how many do you have?    i have none. none.    so i got to, i say, how many federal judges do i have?    sir, you have 142 federal judges.    no, you dont understand the question.    thats impossible. that would mean that president obama didnt appoint 142 judges. you get none. or youre doing a bad job as president because youre representing a different philosophy. very different.    so i came, i said: no, no, no. check it again. then they said, 138. then they came back: actually, sir, the number is 142. we were right the first time.    142 judges. within two months, we will have, john and ted and all of these great congressmen, we will have passed 182 federal judges. and then they say: obama was ... hes such a wonderful president. how are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do, you handed over to the republicans. 142. how is that good? i mean, how is that good? if i were a democrat, i wouldnt be too happy about that number. and well have a record number of judges by the time our term is over in 16 years, maybe 20. im only kidding. im only kidding because every time i do that, they say, see, hes assuming control.    we have this crazy guy on television. and he goes, you know ... hes talking to a guest, he goes, you know hes going to win, dont you? you know hes going to win. i mean, weve done a good job. he should be happy.    but he said,  our military, our schools, our this, everything. he says, you know hes going to win.    and the guest goes, well, no, were going to fight. were going to fight.    no, no, hes going to win. and you know hes never leaving. you know that, dont you? hes never leaving. hes never going to leave.    and i thought this wacko was kidding. hes a comedian. i thought he was kidding. hes serious. he really believes that.    we passed, for the veterans, va choice and va accountability on behalf of those great people. theyve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years. they couldnt get it done. but those guys right there, and me, we got it done. and to protect american security, i withdrew the united states from the horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal. i recognized israels true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem. and we also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights.    for years, you watched as your politicians apologized for america. youve seen it many times. oh, im so sorry. now you have a president whos standing up for america and standing up for your great state of texas.    you must never forget, the 2020 election is about one thing, and its coming up fast, its about you. its about you. one thing: about you. im doing this for you. you know, we had, in 2016, i really believe it was maybe the greatest election.    i guess george washington was good, right? but that was easy. and by the way, he did even better percentage-wise in judges than i did. he had 100%. but we could have 50%. thats not bad. and i had many more than he had.    so i guess you got to give george washington, what do you think, ted, you got to give him something?    id say honest abe, that was a pretty good election, right?    andrew jackson, they say ours topped andrew jackson. but andrew jackson was a good election.    but we had among the greatest elections of all time. but we have to now cement that election. we got to cement it. and once we do, its going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart. thatll be very hard. because its all about your family. its all about your future. and its all about the future fate of our great country. so important.    with your help, we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. together we will elect a republican congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration.    and by the way, thank you, robert jeffress, for being here, wherever you may be in this massive ... wherever you are, robert. where is he? he got up, he started saying, he may not be the greatest person. i said ... this is like four years ago, i see this guy, what a mouthpiece, this guy. and hes a man of god.    and he said: he may not be the greatest, he may not be the most perfect christian. he may not know the bible as well as some of us, but hes a leader. and i love donald trump.    i said: who is that guy? i love that guy.    robert jeffress. wherever. hes a great guy. got a big, big group of people on sunday mornings too, i can tell you.    we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words, that beautiful phrase, i love it, made in the usa.    we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years. were doing that. who would have believed we could do that? were doing that. and the previous administration spent no money on that, and were spending a lot. but think of that. who would have thought that were going to end, within 10 years, the aids epidemic in our country? who would have thought weve advanced that far?    we will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land and throughout the great state of texas. this is a great state. we support, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. thank you.    we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true bedrocks of our society. we believe in the creeds of self-reliance, personal responsibility, and american independence.    we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great american flag. loyal citizens like you helped build this country. and together, we are taking back this country, our country. we love our country. were returning power to you, the american people. thats what weve done.    from dallas to el paso, from houston to austin, from the red river to the rio grande, this state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. texas. this is the state where william travis, james bowie and davy crockett made their last stand at the alamo. this is the state where a small band of patriots at the battle of gonzalez, armed with a single canon, stared down a foreign army and declared,  come and take it.    thank you. and texas is the state where generations of farmers, ranchers, pioneers, and oil workers built a life and a home with their own two beautiful hands. they didnt have a lot of money. they didnt have a lot of luxury, but they all had one thing in common: they loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their god. these courageous texas patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, demolish our liberty, and destroy our proud american heritage. we will never, ever allow that to happen. with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. we are going to keep on fighting. and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.    we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under god. and together we will make america wealthy again. we will make america proud again. we will make america strong again. we will make america safe again. and we will make america great again. thank you, texas. thank you.    (singing).    thank you.   and welcome to the rose garden as we take powerful action to lower healthcare costs for americas seniors. today, im proud to announce that we have reached a breakthrough agreement to dramatically slash the out-of-pocket costs of insulin. you know whats happened to insulin over the years, right? through the roof. insulin, so many people, so necessary. for hundreds and thousands of seniors enrolled in medicare, thats a big deal, participating plans will cap costs at just $35 a month per type of insulin. and some plans may offer it free. so for everybody that was getting ripped off and paying tremendous prices as senior citizens... and seema, i want to thank you because you brought this to my attention a long time ago. and you worked very hard on this day. and the press wont even cover it, but theyll cover things that are unimportant.    but this is a big day for seniors. this is a tremendous saving, and it allows people that... if you dont take insulin... i just wrote this down. you go blind, stroke, amputation, kidney failure, and other things. so were getting it down $35 per month. and it would be anywhere from 50 to 150 to over $200 a month. so its a massive cut, i guess 60-70. nobodys seen anything like this for a long time. sleepy joe, cant do this, that i can tell you. in fact, it was his problem with obamacare that caused part of your problem. this will save impacted americans am average of minimum $ 446 just on insulin costs a year. were pleased to be joined by vice president mike pence and surgeon general jerome adams. i also want to thank seema again. thank you very much for the job youve done helping achieve the incredible victory for medicare patients nationwide.    in the past, obamacare prevented insurance providers from competing to offer lower costs for seniors. there was no competition. there was no anything. and they ran away with what took place and the seniors were horribly hurt. many people couldnt take insulin. they couldnt even think about it. as a result, medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage paid an average of $675 for a years supply of insulin. and sometimes as high as $1500. harmful laws also meant that seniors often paid a different amount almost every single month. they had no idea what they were paying. they were billed. every month they were billed a different amount and it was a massive amount. one in every three, seniors on medicare has diabetes and over 3.3 million beneficiaries use at least one type of insulin. over the past 10 years, these seniors have seen their out-of-pocket cost for this life-saving treatment almost double. i dont use insulin. should i be? huh? i never thought about it. but i know a lot of people are very, very badly affected. unbelievable.    thats why my administration acted decisively. we slashed obamacares crippling requirements and opened up competition like theyve never seen before. theyve never seen competition like this. between transparency and all of the other things were doing, nobodys ever had a competitive situation created like weve done it. and the prices, you will see very soon, theyre going to come tumbling down. then we brought all the parties to the table, insurer, manufacturers, and other key players. and reached an agreement to deliver insulin at stable and drastically lower out-of-pocket costs for our seniors. i hope the seniors are going to remember it. because biden is the one that put us into the jam, because they didnt know what they were doing. they were incompetent. soon, nearly half of all eligible part d and medicare advantage prescription drug plans will offer this low-cost option. and when you say low cost, youre really talking low cost. its giving seniors the freedom and choice to pick the plan thats right for them.    nothing will ever stop me from fulfilling my solemn duty to americas seniors. ill use every power at my disposal to lower drug prices. and my administration will always protect medicare and social security, and, by the way, preexisting conditions. and we got rid of the individual mandate, which is a disaster. the worst part of obamacare was the individual mandate. when we got rid of the individual mandate, essentially, we got rid of obamacare. if you want to know the truth. you can say that in the truest form. but we got rid of a horrible, horrible condition called the individual mandate, but well always protect you on preexisting conditions. much more so than the democrats.    here with us today is bruce broussard, president and ceo of a big powerful healthcare company, humana. and id like to have bruce come up and say a few words, please. bruce? thank you. thats a big company. look how young he is too. thats very young to be running such a big company.    thank you, bruce.    what a job youve done, too. really an amazing job.    youre also in the right business, right?    thats good. well, youve really helped. we appreciate it very much. thank you, bruce. were also joined by tracey brown, the ceo of american diabetes association. a lot of bad things can happen without insulin in terms of diabetes and other things. please, tracey? thank you very much. hi, tracey.    so tracey, are you surprised at how much weve gotten the price down? to what extent and to the level that we brought it down to?    good. thank you much.    appreciate it, tracey. id like to also invite up david ricks, chairman ceo of eli lilly and company, a very big and a very great company. please. hes another young guy.    thank you very much, david.    yeah, and i think we will. thank you very much. thanks, david. appreciate it. really good job. i also want to thank the companies with us today for rising to the occasion in our fight against the invisible enemy. humana and other insurers have agreed to waive copays, which is a very great thing to do. its a big deal. thank you very much. co-insurance, deductibles, coronavirus treatments for most enrollees. people that arent in the business or even in business period, they wouldnt realize how big a thing that is, but its a very big thing and we appreciate it very much.    coronavirus treatment for most enrollees, weve been moving along and were doing well. were going to be reporting on it in just a second. sanofi is working at breakneck speed to create a vaccine. eli lilly has been developing therapeutics for coronavirus and expanding a free drive-through testing operations. and thank you all for the work. its been great. were battling the virus on every front, speeding relief to our work workers and pursuing therapies and vaccines at record speed. we have many companies right now, i think we can say, very far down the line on vaccines and therapeutics... and cures frankly, i think cures are going to be in there very shortly... manufacturing, vast quality quantities and medical equipment supplies. all of the different things that you need. weve energized our military. our military is ready logistically to go out and distribute whatever it is we come up with. and i think were going to come up with a lot. i think were going to have therapeutic remedies and i think were going to have vaccines very shortly. ive been saying it, very shortly. i think ill be proven correct. if im not, im sure the media will let us know about it.    were safely reopening our country while aggressively protecting the vulnerable, especially our seniors. were telling our seniors to stay back a little bit. stay back, let this thing pass. were not only keeping older americans safe from the virus, were also ensuring that they have the best medical care on earth at a price that they can afford. thats what happened with insulin. nobody can believe it when they hear the price of the insulin. its been an amazing difference, and seemas going to be talking about that. thats not just like a 10% drop or a 5% drop, which by itself would be good. thats a big drop. thats a really big drop. we approved a record number of generics and reversed the trend of soaring drug prices...    a good number of generics and reverse the trend of soaring drug prices for the first time in over 50 years. first time weve ever had prices go down. average basic part d premiums drop 13.5% the lowest level in seven years. and were going down very substantially from that level. its going down very, very substantial unless you have a new administration in which case itll go up very substantially that i can guarantee you theyve been doing it to you for years. average medicare advantage premiums have plummeted 28% to the lowest level in over a decade. and thats despite everything thats been happening, which would normally make things go up. and we have more than lets see 1200 more medicare advantage plans today than we did think of that two years ago. so we have 1200 more medicare advantage plans than we did two years ago. thats something. i signed an executive order to crack down on fraud in medicare, and to give beneficiaries faster access to the latest medical devices and therapies and to take all of the fraud money.    were finding a lot of it, all of that money that were finding in florida reduced prices. we provided nearly $1 billion in grants to support home delivered meals and in home care for elderly patients and disabled people during the pandemic. we expanded tele-health, which has really turned out to be a very hot subject, right? people that never thought about it, people that didnt like the idea, right tracy? theyre loving telehealth, its speedy and its a lot less expensive. we expanded telehealth for medicare beneficiaries and the number of patients using it has increased from roughly 11,000 a week to nearly 1.3 million. so we went from 11,000 people to 1.3 million people a week. but very big where youll be seeing it price transparency, some people think its bigger than healthcare. when you look at it, its going to be bigger than healthcare price transparency.    it was signed approximately nine months ago. its going through the process and itll be here by the first of the year. so i hope youre going to remember me just in case the unthinkable happens. but nobody else wouldve gotten it but this administration. price transparency its going to cut your costs tremendously. and that literally one of the biggest people in the field said its going to be a bigger thing, price transparency, bigger than healthcare in a true sense. the cost of healthcare is going to come down very, very substantially. were always working on preexisting conditions and saving your preexisting conditions. and as long as im president, youll always be protected on preexisting conditions. and surprise medical billing is something people are surprised, never in a positive sense and weve written that out and thats going to be very quickly ended.    so youre not going to be surprised, meaning badly surprised, very negatively surprised. its a big thing, people go in they go for an operation they end up literally losing all of their money, losing everything over something that should not happen. surprise medical billing. were using every tool at our disposal to protect our nursing homes from outbreaks. you saw the disaster of how badly some of the governors handled nursing homes. its a disgrace what theyve done, what the governors, what some of the governors have done is a disgrace. we provided states more resources to step up inspections, added shipments of personal protective equipment to all 15,400 medicaid and medicare certified nursing homes and issued a strict new guideline that every nursing home resident and staff are to be tested immediately and that all staff be tested weekly. so were making it very, very tough.    every day of my administration were fighting for our seniors like never before. our seniors are very special people, all of our citizens are special, but our seniors wed have to take care of our seniors. our senior citizens have spent their entire lives working hard, supporting their communities and families and paying into the system. we will not rest until they get the kind of care and support that they have earned and that they deserve. now id like to ask vice president mike pence to come up and say a few words, followed by administrator verma. and i would just like to thank you again for the great job youve done. so well have mike speak and then youll speak and thank you very much. go ahead, mike. thank you.    thank you mike very much. and i think ill just add on to what mike said. if we didnt act quickly and smartly, we would have had in my opinion and in the opinion of others, anywhere from 10 to 20 and maybe even 25 times the number of deaths. we closed the border to china, meaning we put on the ban people coming in from china. that was a very big moment as dr. fauci said, we saved thousands and thousands of lives when we did that. and thats true, but i think we would have had anywhere from 10 to 20 or 25 times the number of deaths if we didnt act the way we did. and also if we didnt act swiftly. so were very proud of our team and our taskforce and mike, great job.    ... proud of our team and our task force and mike, great job. seema, please.    thank you, seema.    thats very nice. and many, many people feel the same way. they cant actually believe it. $35 and less. and less. and they were being ripped off at a level that nobodys seen before. but thats true with a lot of other things and were taking care of them, too. so i want to thank everybody for being here. in particular, these great executives. thank you very much. thank you very much. you were very impressive in your speech by the way. thank you very much. john, please.    your questions early. were doing it now. were doing something now. i think youll find it very interesting, but i wont be talking about it today. ill be talking about it over the next couple of days, john, okay? but its a very important question. yes, please. anybody? yeah, please.    no, biden can wear a mask, but he was standing outside with his wife, perfect conditions, perfect weather. theyre inside, they dont wear masks. and so i thought it was very unusual that he had one on. but i thought that was fine. i wasnt criticizing them at all. why would i ever do a thing like that? and your second question was? i couldnt hear you.    can you take it off because i cannot hear you.    okay. because you want to be politically correct. go ahead.    go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.    yeah. a lot of people suggest that and hopefully someday people are going to find out. certainly a very suspicious situation. very sad. very sad and very suspicious. question, please?    go ahead, please go.    yeah, i have, but im sure that ultimately they want to get to the bottom of it. and its a very serious situation. i also saw a clip with joe and imus where they were having a lot of fun at her expense. and i thought it was totally inappropriate. now its a very suspicious thing. and i hope somebody gets to the bottom of it. itll be a very good thing. as you know, theres no statute of limitations. so it would be a very good, very good thing to do. okay. whos next? any questions on insulin? yeah, please.    were taking a look at it very strongly. theyre going to report this afternoon. ill be looking at it this afternoon.    no, its something youre going to be hearing about before the end of the week. very powerfully, i think. yeah please.    i could ask that question to anybody like to discuss that. do you want to discuss it, please? go ahead. do you know the answer? either one of you or both. come on and lets get these highly paid executives up here to give the answer. seema, please. jerome. we picked a good one. we got it right.    thank you very much. and tracy, do you agree with that?    and the question i found to be a very interesting one, but is that an unusual question or an unusual circumstance?    right. okay, good. i thought it was a very good question, actually. please go ahead.    well, were just putting a ban on, as you know, going on immediately, essentially, almost immediately to brazil and from brazil into our country. so from brazil to the united states, having a very hard time in brazil. well be doing certain announcements on other countries, including europe, as we move along and where theyre making progress, well start to open it up. but only where theyre making progress. theyre making some good progress. i think were making very good progress.    were making very good progress on the economy. the numbers are better than anybody would have anticipated. and certainly i think thats been reflected in the stock market, which had a very big day. and its over 25,000. and when you think 25,000 is a very high number, when you think that it was at 29,000 and now its at 25, thats a very big day. its up very substantially over the last six months. so we had a very big day. but people are seeing whats happening. and theyre seeing there is a pent up demand as i was predicting and youre going to see it more and more. we call it the transition to greatness and it really is. were going to have a third quarter thats going to be good. were going to have a fourth quarter that has the potential to be really good. and were going to have one of the best years weve ever had next year. thats what we see. yeah. john, go ahead.    well, i think everyone knows were down to less than 8,000 troops, were with leadership in many different fields and in many different parts of that country, were dealing with the taliban, were dealing with the president, the president now has gotten themselves straightened out with the two presidents. but were dealing with because as yo know, they had competing factors in factions.    yeah. i think we want to get ... were there 19 years. were really not acting as soldiers. were acting as police. and were not set over there to be policemen, but were there 19 years. and yeah, i think thats enough. and they understand were having a very positive talks. we want to bring our soldiers back home. we want to bring them back home. and were not only talking about there. were talking about other countries, also. we bring our soldiers back home.    we can always go back if we have to. we have to go back, well go back and well go back raging. and they will go back as warriors, fighters. but right now were policing and were not meant to be a police force. were meant to be a fighting force.    no. i have no target, but as soon as reasonable over a period of time. but as soon as reasonable. were down to 7,000, some odd soldiers right now. and in iraq, were down to 4,000 soldiers. so were making a lot of progress. in syria, you remember john on the border when i took the soldiers out of the border, everyone said, oh, thats so terrible. well, i spoke to president [erdogan 00:41:03] yesterday of turkey. the border has been fine without us. theyd been policing that border for 2,000 years. all of a sudden we had thousands of soldiers there doing their work. for what? guarding syria and turkey on a border, a very long border. no, we want our trips back home. we took them out. that was a year ago. i was criticized. nothing happened except theyre watching their own borders now. we kept the oil, but at some point well take care of the kurds with respect to the oil and get out.    yeah, please go ahead.    yeah, hes coming in.    i would imagine we would, but he asked for the meeting, so well see what he wants. but he asked for the meeting, governor cuomo and will be coming in sometime tomorrow.    yeah. please go ahead.    yeah. id like to hear it too. i mean, id like to hear the fbi agent said that he didnt lie and certainly the conversation almost regardless, it was a good conversation. he was allowed to do it and the mueller people who have been proven very bad, very bad things they did. a lot of bad things of being found out about the hoax. greatest hoax in the history of our country and it was an illegal hoax and a very dangerous hoax and a lot of bad things have been found out about mueller and the gang.    so i would like to hear that conversation. yeah. i would like to hear it personally, so whatever they want me to do, ill do, i think rick grinell has done an incredible job and things are happening now that i always knew this was the answer. this was an attempted coup by a bunch of dirty cops and others. these are dirty cops, dishonest slime bags.    all right. yeah. question. go ahead, jeff.    i can absolutely do it if i want to and i dont think im going to have to because its starting to open up. we need our churches and our synagogues and our mosques. we want them open. churches, synagogues, mosques, and other, we want them open and we want them open as soon as possible.    now i can tell you, i know a lot of pastors, a lot of rabbis, imams, and they want to take care of their people. they want to take care. they dont want anyone getting hurt or sick and theyre going to take care of their people. we need these people. we need people that are going to be leading us in faith that were opening them up and if i have to, i will override any governor that wants to play games.    if they want to play games, thats okay, but we will win. we have many different ways where i can override them and if i have to ill do that but we want our churches and our synagogues and our mosques, et cetera., we want them open.    now, there may be some areas by the way, where the pastor or whoever may feel that its not quite ready and thats okay. thats okay but let that be the choice of the congregation and the pastor.    john, go ahead,    well, as you know, we dont have much time because we have to know that if were going to spend millions of dollars on an arena, we want to be in north carolina. i love north carolina. i won north carolina. we just had a big two races that we won recently for congress in north carolina; two very big races that the press didnt want to report on. if we would have lost them, it would have been the biggest story in political history, but we just won two races. its a very important place to me. i love north carolina.    in fact, my son, eric and laura named a baby carolina and came from, i think both, but she was born in north carolina as you know, laura. so its a very important place to me. but at the same time, and i think that people understand this, we have a governor that doesnt want to open up the state and we have a date of august, at the end of august, and we have to know before we spend millions and millions of dollars on an arena to make it magnificent for the convention and we have tremendous people. i mean the economic development consequences are tremendous for the state. we have to know that when the people come down, theyre going to have the doors open.    now, if the governor cant tell us very soon, unfortunately, well have no choice. this has nothing to do with us. this is between the governor and north carolina and the people of north carolina. but the people want it and well have to see whether or not the governor... now hes a democrat and a lot of the democrats for political reasons, dont want to open up their states. so well see if that works but i dont think it will. id love to have it in north carolina. that was why i chose it, charlotte, but were going to see, were going to see and at the end, we need a fast decision from the governor. hes going to have to get, because hes been acting very, very slowly and very suspiciously, but well find out.    question, please.    yeah. were talking about a very short period of time. its a massive expenditure and we have to know. yeah, i would say within a week that certainly we have to know. now if he cant do it, if he feels that hes not going to do it, all he has to do is tell us and then well have to pick another location. and i will tell you a lot of locations want it but i picked north carolina because i do love that state and it would have been a perfect place for it and it still would be. but hes got to say that when thousands of people come to the arena that theyll be able to get in. does that make sense?    i mean well spend millions and millions of dollars on this magnificent design, but in the end, they have to be able to get in. i dont want to have it where we get there and then they announced after all the money was spent, all the work was done, all the people travel in, guess what? you cant put anybody in the arena or you can put a tiny number of people in the arena. we cant do that, john. yeah, please go ahead.    i think its fine. look, the governors in certain ways have to do what they want to do but they have to tell me what theyre doing. when it comes to churches, et cetera, they will be overwritten by me. when it comes to other things and many other things they want. if i think some things being done incorrectly or wrong, im going to do it. but you have different governors and they have very different views on where they are and where theyre going. so well see what happens. please. go ahead.    yeah. always be safe. you want to be safe. were opening up but you want to be safe? go ahead, please.    you mean mail-in voting?    well, thats going to be in a long time from now, number one. its quite a ways away, number one. but when you do a all mail-in voting ballots, youre asking for fraud. people steal them out of mailboxes. people print them and then they sign them and they give them in. people dont even know where the double counted. people take them away. they force people to vote.    they harvest. you know what harvesting is? they take many, many ballots and they put them all together and then they just dump them and nobody has any idea whether theyre crooked or not. look, you do mail-in voting.    now its another thing to do absentee voting or if somebody has a medical condition where they go through a process and they get an absentee ballot, thats okay. thats different. but in california, the governor sent, i hear or sending millions of ballots all over the state. millions to anybody. to anybody. people that arent citizens, illegals, anybody that walks in california is going to get a ballot. were not going to destroy this country by allowing things like that to happen. were not destroying our country. this has more to do with fairness and honesty and really our country itself because when that starts happening, you dont have a fare. you have a rigged system. you have a rigged system and thats what would happen.    so mail-in ballots and the governor of california did better than any, that i could ever do in terms of explaining. when he sent out or will send out, and i dont know, i think its maybe partially already done, millions and millions of ballots to anybody in california, thats walking or breathing, many of those people dont have the right to vote. well, theyll be voting and you know what? were not going to let it happen because youre subverting our process and youre making our country a joke and the democrats are doing it because in theory, its good for them. although last week we two big races. we won in wisconsin and one in california. california, 25. we won a tremendous race in california.    that was interesting because at the end of the race, they brought in the democrat governor, same governor. he brought in voting booths, not mail-in. voting booths because they were losing. they saw that through the ballots. but no, you cant do that. you cant do the mail-in ballots because youre going to have tremendous fraud.    remember what i said, therell be grabbing them from mailboxes. theyll even be printing them. theyll use the same paper, the same machines and theyll be printing ballots illegally and therell be sending them in by the hundreds of thousands and nobodys going to know the difference. we cant do that. you want to vote. you really have to. absentee is okay. youre sick. as an example, i have to do an absentee because im voting in florida and i happened to be president. i live in that very beautiful house over there. thats painted white. so thats okay and its okay for people that are sick and they cant get up something. but voting is a great honor. its a great honor and people love to go out and vote and i want to keep it that way. if we dont keep it that way, well have nothing but a rigged system of this country. we cant do that. thank you very much, everybody. thank you.   hello everybody, thank you. thank you very much everybody. please. thats a nice crowd on a nice cool day. its beautiful though. might be hot but its beautiful. were here today to celebrate and expand our historic campaign to rescue american workers from job-killing regulations. before i came into office, american workers were smothered by merciless avalanche of wasteful and expensive and intrusive federal regulation. these oppressive burdensome mandates were a stealth tax on our people, slashing take home pay, suppressing innovation, surging the cost of goods, and shipping millions of american jobs overseas. millions and millions and millions, it never ended. nearly four years ago, we ended this regulatory assault on the american worker and we launched the most dramatic regulatory relief campaign in american history by far. no other administration has done anywhere near. thank you.    at the heart of this effort was a revolutionary promise, for every one new regulation issued, we pledged that two federal regulations would be permanently removed. we not only met that ambitious goal which at the time people said was impossible, we vastly exceeded it. for every one new regulation added, nearly eight federal regulations have been terminated. been an incredible achievement. as you can see behind me, we have removed the gigantic regulatory burden americans have forced to carry for decades, freeing our citizens to reach their highest potential. our historic regulatory relief is providing the average american household an extra $3,100.00 every single year and were going up from that number. were going up from that number. think of that. $3,100.00 per household. joining us today is vice president mike pence. thank you mike. commerce secretary wilbur ross, wilbur, thank you very much. labor secretary eugene scalia, thank you, thank you [inaudible 00:02:43]. health and human services secretary alex azar. thank you alex. transportation secretary elaine chao. thank you elaine. we had a great day in georgia yesterday, cutting regulations like nobodys ever seen before. epa administrator andrew wheeler, thank you andrew, thank you very much. omb acting director russ vought, thank you russ, and small business administrator, i love her name, jovita carranza. jovita, thank you, thank you, and cms administrator seema verma, thank you seema. great people. those are great people, theyre doing an incredible job. i also want to thank the many state and local, tribal leaders who join us in this great cause. thank you very much and thank you for being here. we appreciate it. thank you all very much. what we have achieved together is truly without precedent, never happened before. the previous administration added over 16,000 pages of heavy-handed regulations to the federal register. thats why nothing got done. under my administration, we have removed nearly 25,000 pages of job-destroying regulations, more than any other president by far in the history of our country, whether it was four years, eight years, or in one case, more than eight years. the prior administration piled up more than 600 major new regulations, a cruel and punishing regulatory burden that cost the average american an additional $2,300.00 per year. think of that, the average american $ 2,300.00 regulation, hitting low-income americans by far the hardest.    these regulations also inflicted a steep economic toll on african-american communities. by contrast our reforms are putting more money into the pockets of hardworking americans. in addition to saving every family more than $3,000.00 per year, my administration has just issued another reform that my council of economic advisors estimates will lower the price of new vehicles by more than $2,200.00 per vehicle and i think were going to get that up to $3,500.00 per vehicle. its very exciting, and by the way, the vehicles will be better, theyll be stronger, and theyll be safer. our regulation cuts are also delivering massive savings on broadband internet services and some home energy bills will be really historically cut. its actually amazing, as well as historically low gasoline prices. gasoline prices, you look today, i think it was $1.99. at the same time, we saved our oil companies. we are now the largest since weve been here, the largest energy source in the world. nobodys even close so its great but we saved them. they had a hard time a number of months ago and frankly for a long time but weve saved them. $1.99 they were telling me, in some cases lower than that.    were bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, shower heads and faucets. so shower heads, you take a shower, the water doesnt come out. you want to wash your hands, the water doesnt come out. so what do you do? you just stand there longer, you take a shower longer. because my hair, i dont know about you, but it has to be perfect. perfect. dishwashers, you didnt have any water so the people that do the dishes, you press it and it goes again and you do it again and again. so you might as well give them the water because youll end up using less water. so we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water and in many places, in most places of the country, water is not a problem. they dont know what to do with it. its called rain. they dont have a problem. and old-fashioned, incandescent light bulbs, i brought them back, i brought them back. they have two nice qualities, theyre cheaper and theyre better. they look better, they make you look so much better, thats important to all of us, but theyre better and much cheaper and they were mandated out, legislated out, and we brought them back and theyre selling like hot cakes.    we stopped the egregious abuse of the clean water act which extreme activists have used to shut down construction projects all across our country. when i signed that legislation i had many farmers and construction people standing behind me. people that havent cried since they were babies, some of them never even when they were a baby and they were crying. many people were crying. we gave them back their life. they took away their land, they took away their rights, they took away their life. by reigning in epa overreach, my administration has returned the agency to its core mission of insuring clean air, clean water, and a truly pristine natural environment. our air now and our water is as clean as its been in the last four decades. yesterday our country achieved yet another groundbreaking milestone by completing a sweeping overhaul of americas badly broken infrastructure approval process. it was totally out of control.    instead of taking up to 20 years to approve a major project, were cutting the federal permitting timeline, its already been done, to a maximum of two years or less, in some cases even less than one year. its possible that it wont qualify, its possible that it wont be good environmentally or safety-wise, in which case at least in a period of a year or two, well raise the hand and you wont make it, but most projects will make it but you wont go for 10, 15, 18 or 20 years. there are many horror stories that we could relate.    were reclaiming americas proud heritage as a nation of builders. my administration has also eliminated massive regulatory barriers. in our battle against the china virus, these actions saved countless lives, speeding up the production of equipment. that means ventilators like nobodys ever seen before. probably the greatest source of manufacturing, the greatest achievement since world war ii. were now making ventilators for countries all over the world.    medicine, accelerating the delivery of life-saving treatments and ensuring that we will have a vaccine in a record time. were doing fantastically well on that. that will be for another time, another meeting, but we are doing on therapeutics and vaccines incredibly well. no administration in history has removed more red tape more quickly to rescue the economy and to protect the health of our people. when you think of it, we are all set up, that as we get the vaccine or therapeutic, and were set up militarily, were going to be delivering it in record time. its all set to move. we put an investment upfront and we have logistical people, generals, great people. theyre going to be delivering this all over the country as soon as we have it and weve made tremendous progress, youve been reading about it.    in total weve taken more than 740 actions to suspend regulations that would have slowed our response to the china virus. this includes lifting restrictions on manufacturers so that our great auto workers could produce more than 100,000 ventilators so weve done over 100,000 in 100 days. think of that, and we didnt have ventilators, we werent set up for ventilators. we became a country thats making a lot of them. helping so many others. countries that are never going to be in a position to make them. theyre complex, theyre expensive, theyre big. very, very, very tough to do and weve saved a lot of lives. theres never been a person in our country, even though we started with almost nothing, i say the cupboard was bare when we took over, we started with nothing. theres never been a person in our country, even though we had just absolutely ... we were going on empty, never been one person that needed a ventilator that didnt get it. think of that. not one person, as complex as they are, as big, as expensive. take a long time to get them done. not one person has ever needed a ventilator that didnt get it. we made telemedicine, thank you. great job. great ... really a great job. the people here, they get no credit for it. i dont want any credit, they should get    people here, they get no credit for it, i dont want any credit. they should get the credit, but they get no credit, but weve done a great job helping so many other countries now. we made telemedicine available to all american patients, and allowed doctors to work across state lines. i will tell you, the telemedicine is something thats really gone up by thousands, and thousands of percentage points, of percent, because what happened is, people that wouldnt even think of using telemedicine all of a sudden started using it, and its really turned out to be good. really, really turned out to be good, and it solved a lot of problems, so thats something thats been great advancement.    furthermore, ive ordered federal agencies to look for ways to make these healthcare reforms totally permanent. vice president pence is also working closely with state, local, and tribal leaders to streamline occupational licensing. over 30 states have taken steps to reduce these barriers to unemployment, and to employment, and including a state that i love very much. i have a little history in that state, the great state of alaska. thank you very much, governor, for being here, mike dunleavy. mike, thank you very much    in idaho, governor brad little who is here today with us as well set a new record for regulatory relief. good job, brad. good, good governor, great governor. two great governors. the american people know best how to run their own lives. they dont need washington bureaucrats controlling their every move and micromanaging their every decision. with each regulation we cut, were not only returning the money, and the power to our citizens, we are draining the washington swamp, and theyre not happy about it. i can tell you that. i think you know that.    the swamp was deep. i just didnt know how deep, deeper than i thought. joining us today are a few of the countless americans who are personally benefiting from our pro-worker reforms. joe cambria owns cambria truck center in new jersey, good state, new jersey, and its been really something that hes seen firsthand, how our regulation cuts have helped create thousands and thousands of jobs. joe, please come up, and say a few words. thank you, joe.    thank you very much. thank you. good job, good job. that was easy. wasnt it? thank you very much, great job. dr. amy johnson is a nurse practitioner in rural virginia. amy, please come up and share with us how important expanded health care and telehealth has been for you, and your patients. thank you. thank you very much.    thank you very much, great job, thank you. so, thats been a great help to you, telehealth, its been an incredible thing. great job. thank you very much. jim shelton is a rancher from arizona who was crushed by the obama, biden administrations ridiculous waters of the united states rule. its been a catastrophic rule, but its gone now, which gave bureaucrats power to regulate every puddle on private land or a lake. jim, please come up, and tell us of your experience, which i know wasnt a good one, but its a good one now, please.    thank you jim. thank you very much, thank you jim.    that was my honor jim, and thank you very much. its terrible, that you had to suffer for so long, and they took your property away from you, and you want to take care of your property better than any government is going to tell you to take care of your property. youll take care of it better, so we dont have to worry about that. thank you very much, beautifully said, thank you. i want to just, as president say that i will always fight to defend your rights, and your freedoms. i will fight very hard for your rights, and your freedoms. the [inaudible 00:22:12] wants to reverse these extraordinary gains and reimpose these disasters regulations. they want to take what weve taken off, jim, and they want to put them back on, and i guess they can do that.    youll fight him for a little while, but eventually, youll lose, and they want to bury our economy under suffocating, relentless landslides of washington red tape, like we had before i got here. we must never return to the days of soul crushing regulation that ravaged our cities, devastated our workers, drained our vitality right out of our people, and thoroughly crippled our nations prized competitive edge. its what we have. we have great, great people. the greatest people in the world. our entire economy, and our very way of life are threatened by bidens plans to transform our nation, and subjugate our communities through the blunt force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you havent even seen yet.    do you think that was bad? you havent even seen it yet. they want to go many times what they put you under in the past. under the unity platform, joe biden published with socialist bernie sanders, they are proposing, and this is all in writing. its done. they agreed. they are proposing to reenter the job killing unfair paris climate accord, which will cost our country trillions of dollars, trillions and trillions of dollars, and put us in a very, very bad competitive position relative to the world. not surprising to you, china will be greatly advanced under this ridiculous agreement, so will russia, so will many other countries. they proposed to mandate...    ... other countries. they propose to mandate net zero emissions from all new homes and buildings, skyrocketing the cost of construction and putting the goal of home ownership out of reach for millions. destroying the look of the home, the beauty of the home, im somebody thats built many homes, many buildings. if you take a look at this, it doesnt look good. you still have to sell, right? you still have to sell, but theyve put it out of reach from a cost standpoint, totally out of reach. its not practical, its not good and it doesnt work.    they want to eliminate carbon from the us energy industry, which means abolishing all american oil, clean coal and natural gas. no coal, no gas, no oil, nothing to fire our massive plants. the result of this federally mandated shut down would be the wholesale destruction of the entire energy industry and many other industries, the economic evisceration of entire communities and the unfettered offshoring of millions of our best jobs to foreign countries and foreign polluters. millions and millions of jobs would go, thousands and thousands of countries would be at a level that youve never seen. companies would be disappearing, left, and right, just like they did with nafta, which we terminated for the usmca, which is another beauty that weve done, not for now, but another great beauty.    but thousands of companies, plants, factories would be closed. under this dismal future energy would be unaffordable for the vast majority of americans and the american dream would be sniffed out so quickly and replaced with a socialist disaster. the democrats in dc have been in one, two at a much higher level abolish our beautiful and successful suburbs by placing far left washington bureaucrats in charge of local zoning decisions. theyre absolutely determined to eliminate single family zoning, to destroy the value of houses and communities already built, just as they have in minneapolis and other locations that you read about today. your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise.    joe biden and his bosses from the radical left, want to significantly multiply what theyre doing now. and what will be the end result is you will totally destroy the beautiful suburbs. suburbia will be no longer as we know it. so they want to defund and abolish your police and law enforcement, while at same time destroying our great suburbs. the suburb destruction will end with us. next week, i will be discussing the affh rule, affh rule, a disaster. and our plans to protect the suburbs from being obliterated by washington democrats, by people on the far left that want to see the suburbs destroyed that dont care. people have worked all their lives to get into a community and now theyre going to watch it go to hell, not going to happen, not while im here.    the biden/bernie plan would also use the weapon of federal regulation to tie the hands of our police departments by abolishing cash bail, think of that. think of that bail, no problem, they killed somebody let them out. take a look at whats happening, crime in new york city up 368% from just a short while ago. they got rid of a lot of police and theyre in the process of doing it, a billion dollars. they probably want to abolish... its not even believable. when i first heard about it, when you first heard about it, you didnt think it was real, you didnt think it was believable. just like the green new deal, how crazy is that? but theyre actually trying to put it into play, itll mean the end of this country.    so by getting rid of bail, they are incentivizing jail and prison closures. they want to get rid of prisons, they dont think anybody should go to prison. setting loose violent criminals, appointing left-wing social justice prosecutors, like you have in philadelphia, where people creating and doing the most criminal of acts are let go in many cases immediately and making our wonderful cops, our great, great police, cops, subordinate to distant bureaucrats who have never spent a day in their lives fighting crime.    unlike the socialists, we believe in the rule of the people, not the rule of the unelected bureaucrats that dont know what theyre doing. we believe in the dignity of the individual, not the iron grip of the state. our regulatory reforms are vital, not only to the success of our economy but the strength of our democracy and the survival of liberty itself. my administration will continue pressing forward until we have made every last vestige of washington fully, completely, and totally accountable to the citizens of the united states. we are putting our faith in the workers who power our country, the doctors who care for our country, the truckers who sustain our country and the farmers and ranchers who preserve our country in all of its majestic beauty. the american people are the ones who made our nation great and together we will make it greater by far than ever before. god bless you and god bless america. thank you very much for being with us. thank you very much. thank you. thank you very much. thank you. thank you very much. thank you.    we must have said something right, i guess we said it absolutely right. its about our country, its about our country. we want to be strong. we want to respect everybody, but we have to have strong law enforcement and thats taking place in the areas that were responsible for. we want others to call us for help, theres nothing wrong. let chicago call, let seattle call, we where going into seattle, all set to go and then they did it themselves. they heard we were coming in and the hands went up, they gave up. and its so terrible when you see whats happening. minneapolis, we said, get the guard in there. three nights, get the guard in, get the guard. we got the guard in. the national guard, theyve done a fantastic job.    as soon as they showed up, it was like a knife cutting through butter. you saw that, right? after four days of horror, it wasnt the polices fault in any of these places, they were told to leave. the police are, generally speaking, they do a great job. they were told to leave, but you so what happened. minneapolis, grab your gun and run. thats not what they wanted to do. but the national guard came in and we did a great job. no problem, after that, did you notice?    we just passed a statues and monument executive order and they were going well, now you see that beautiful... look at it right there its so beautiful, the washington monument. if they had their choice theyd take it down, and i guarantee you theyd rename it. they want to rename it, they want george washington out. they won thomas jefferson out. they want abraham lincoln out. they want abolitionists out. they dont know what they want, they just want to destroy our country. were not going to let it happen, were not letting it happen. so id now like to ask vice president mike pence to say a few words. thank you, mike. thank you.    thank you very much, brad. thank you. thank you, brad.    you are.    thank you very much. thank you very much, mike. thank you. we have many exciting things that well be announcing over the next eight weeks i would say. things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible and things that were going to get done and we have gotten done. weve started in most cases, but its going to be a very exciting eight weeks. a eight weeks, i think mike, we can honestly say nobodys ever going to see eight weeks like were going to have, because we really have. were taking on immigration, taking on education, were taking on so many aspects of things that people were hopelessly tied up in knots in congress. theyve been working on some of these things for 25, 30 years, wasnt happening.    but youll see levels of detail and youll see levels of thought that a lot of people believed very strongly we didnt have in this country. were going to get things done. were going to get things done that theyve wanted to see done for a long, long time. i think well start sometime on tuesday. well be discussing our one plan on suburbia, but thats one of many, many different plans. then were going into the immigration, the world of immigration. the world of education. were going into the world of healthcare, very complete healthcare. and we have a lot of very exciting things to discuss, but cutting of regulation has been really something that i felt we could do and we could do fairly easily. nothings easy in this country.    we had statutory requirements where wed do phase one and then wed have to wait 90 days, wed do phase two and wed have to wait 60 days. we do phase three and we said, lets do phase four, sir, im sorry, you have to wait one year. but we were able to do things that nobody has ever been able to do or even close on deregulation. and these trucks, this really is a great, a great little example. i dont know who thought of this idea, but its actually quite simple and quite good. is that brooke? quite simple and quite good. i dont love having that big sucker hanging over my head. i want to get out of here as fast as possible, but i do want to thank you all incredible people. youve done an incredible job. and to the speakers, please. thank you very much. great job. thank you very much. thank you everybody. thank you. thank you. thank you, brad.   thank you, president trump. we do, thank you very much, all, appreciate it. were here this morning to announce dramatic action to support our nations farmers, ranchers and growers as we work to safely reopen america and its happening very fast. much faster, and with much better numbers than anybody would have thought. i want to begin by expressing our profound gratitude to everyone here today and the farmers and producers across the country, who have kept our nation fed and nourished as we have battled the invisible enemy. it is an invisible enemy. its tough, but were going to win and were going to win very big.    but we can never forget all of the people that have been left behind, that have died. for some reason that shouldve never happened, should have never happened. you know that, i know that, and the people that caused the problem, they know that too. its too bad. you remind us once again that the american farmers, the backbone of our country, and theyre really a great friend of mine and i appreciate all the support, and i know they appreciate our support. were glad to be joined by secretary sonny perdue, along with ivanka, who has been working closely with sonny to deliver this vital assistance for farmers and needy families.    im also grateful to the president of the american farm bureau federation, zippy duvall. thank you very much. thank you and thank you, zippy, thank you. the president of the national cattlemans beef association, marty smith. marty, thank you, marty. and several of our great agricultural producers, nice to meet all of you. its really good to meet you. zippy, youre doing okay?    you got my condolences i hope, right?    okay. zippy was married to a great woman. and for purposes of the record, you still are, you always will be, right? she was a great person.    yeah, no. she was a great person. from day one, my administration has been determined to protect our nations incredible farmers. we enacted historic tax cuts and helped the family farms stay in the family. what we did is we passed, as you know in the tax cuts, the death tax, the inheritance tax, small farms and ranchers and even businesses, you dont have to pay it, its a big deal. instead of losing your farm, you keep your farm. i think that was a big deal, what do you think?    maybe your farm is so big it doesnt qualify.    no, but we eliminated that horrible death tax. and most of the kids, many of the kids lost the farm, they go borrow to pay the tax and then they ended up losing the farms, right? you dont have to pay that tax anymore. i think thats one of the reasons that farmers like me, i guess, but hopefully thats not the only reason. we eliminated crushing washington regulations, kept our promise on ethanol and replaced and negotiated a badly broken trade deals to finally give you a fair and level playing field. when china unfairly targeted our farmers, we provided $28 million in direct assistance. and it came from china, not from our government and you know that happened and they paid for it, we didnt pay. they have this misconception, they like to say this as much as possible. china devalued their currency in order to pay it. we didnt pay it. and what we did is we helped. i went to sonny, we had $12 billion two years ago. we had $16 billion last year. and this year youll be hearing about what were doing because its very substantial. and through the paycheck protection program, we have approved billions of dollars in relief to farmers as part of our unprecedented coronavirus relief efforts. so the paycheck has been a fantastic success as you know. now were standing strong with our farmers and ranchers once again. in normal times, roughly 40% of fresh vegetables and about 40% of beef grown and raised in the united states is distributed to restaurants and other commercial food establishments. but as you know, the virus has forced many of our nations restaurants to temporarily close. and this has taken a major toll on our farmers and growers. some of whom were dealing directly with restaurants. i didnt realize that until yesterday, we were with the big restaurants and said they sometimes will deal directly with your farmer, no middlemen, no nothing, just directly and its a big business.    for this reason my administration is launching a sweeping new initiative, the coronavirus food assistance program. through this effort, we are providing $19 billion to support our nations agricultural producers, maintain the health of our critical food supply chains and provide food assistance to american families, $19 billion. no other presidents done this, zippy. i tell you, you could go back to abraham lincoln, theres no president thats treated the farmers like trump. no, no, no. i hear were doing well with the farmers, but i cant imagine ... i want to find out who wouldnt be, who wouldnt be with trump, right? but its an honor to do it, actually. its an honor, theyre great people. these are great, great people. as part of this program today, were announcing $16 billion direct payments to farmers and ranchers. so $16 billion is going directly to the farmers and ranchers.    and its authorized by the cares act and the commodity credit corporation charter act. we fought hard for this. these payments will compensate farmers for losses related to the global pandemic, caused by china. well be providing billions of dollars for corn, cotton, soybean and specialty crop farmers, cattle ranchers, just about every category. i think we have almost every category and if we dont, were going to add them, all right. if we left something out, but we have a lot of territory, dairy producers, pork producers, and more. i read yesterday where we take some cattle in from other countries because we have trade deals. i think you should look at terminating those deals, all right?    we have trade deals where we actually take in cattle and we have a lot of cattle in this country. and i think you should look at the possibility of terminating those trade deals. now, if a country has been a great country and a great ally and a great friend, you have to do that. but there are some countries that are sending us cattle for many years. and i think we should look at terminating. were very self sufficient and were becoming more and more self sufficient. probably one of the reasons i got elected. sign ups will begin on may 26 through your local farm service agency offices. they got to go sign up to pick it up, to get the money. and well start issuing payments within one week of receiving your application. so thats a lot of money, youre talking about a total of $16 billion plus three billion.    we bought last week and its already in distribution, three billion dollars worth of product for the food lines. is this already in distribution? i see that theyre handing it out. i see where they couldnt get food, theyre having a hard time. and we have these incredible ranchers and farmers that have so much food. and i said, lets spend that money and give it to our farmers, our ranchers and its worked out really well. and theyve already got it in supply, its already on the lines. i saw them handing it out today, a couple of days ago, actually, its fantastic how quickly it works. in addition, this important initiative also includes a new farmers to families food box program, which ivanka and secretary perdue helped officially launch on friday.    through this effort, the department of agriculture will work with local food distribution companies and we have a lot of great distribution companies, ive gotten to meet some of them. which have also been hit very hard to purchase three billion dollars of food and produce from the american farmer, which i just mentioned, and to deliver to the food banks and charities that serve needy families. already, weve allocated one point two billion dollars to farmers to families, funding through 198 contracts with distribution companies. many of which are small businesses adversely impacted also by this horrible plague. its a plague. here today are a few of the american farmers and ranchers who can tell us why this program has been so essential and successful. scott sink is a cattle producer, his business has been badly impacted by the virus. he says this initiative will provide a bridge to help them move forward. and weve been helping them in a lot of other ways too, but this was a great help. and scott, please come forward. thank you, scott.    thank you, scott. thank you very much.    thank you very much and you love that business. you wouldnt trade businesses for anything, right?    what is it with farmers? they dont want to do anything else. they have some bad years but weve helped them have very good years actually. but they have some bad years but they wouldnt trade it for anything would they?    thats true and then they start making money and they go out and buy bigger tractors. maybe theyll slow it up a little bit the next time. right. but you guys are great.    robert mills raises both crops and livestock and he believes this program will help countless farm families get buy and more than by, as we begin to reopen our economy and its opening up really fast. robert, please come up. robert. thank you.    thank you very much. i love his accent. i love that accent. is that originally from virginia?    oh, i see and they like trump.    they like trump. thats thats great area. thank you very much. great job. you know, the farmers were targeted by china when we started negotiating tough with china and what i did is weve taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. sonny was very aware of this because he had to distribute the money to the farmers. i said, sonny, weve taken in a lot of money. how much did the farmers lose? this is two years ago.    they were targeted for an amount. what do you think? the impact? he said, $12 billion. so i said, thats okay. well take $12 billion out of our tariff money, which was many billions, more than that, that china paid. never paid us 25 cents, by the way. before that, before trump, they never paid anything. i said, well take 12 billion out of the tens of billions of dollars that we took in and were going to give it to the farmers. and you distributed that money and zippy, i think you were shocked because youve never seen anything.    otherwise these farmers wouldnt have been in business. so we took 12 million. we gave it to the farmers. we said, thank you very much to china. thank you very much, china, and then the next year i said, sonny, whats the number? we called zippy. we called some of the other people. we determined it was $16 billion that the farmers were targeted; 16 billion by china.    so i took 16 billion out of the tariffs, which were many, many billions of tens of billions more than that. we gave it to the farmers, right? this year the same thing. its been pretty amazing and the farmers are doing fine. one of them said, i do better this way. but you know what? they dont want to do better that way. they just want a level playing field but we took care of our farmers. right? and ranchers. thank you, robert. that was great. appreciate it.    david hickman is a vegetable grower who runs dublin farms in virginia. his potatoes will be among the produce distributed to local food banks through the farmers to families program and david, please come up and say a few words.    hi, david.    see a five pound bags, what other size bags do you have?    so is potato a big business in virginia.    how does that area compare with idaho?    is it a very similar product, would you say? or is it different?    could you grow an idaho?    thats very good.    just interesting to me.    thats great.    you love that business.    beautiful business. beautiful way to live.    thank you very much.    great job. gave me a little education but thats interesting. i wonder if the media enjoyed that? i dont think so but thats okay. i might. be careful. i might. ill be there. were going after virginia with your crazy governor. were going after virginia.    they want to take your second amendment away. you know that, right? youll have nobody guarding your potatoes.    as each of you demonstrate a healthy economy is vital to maintaining a healthy society and by working together, we can restore our economy, shield the vulnerable, care for the needy, deliver world class healthcare and vanquish the virus.    i have to say, the job you do is so powerful and so important. the american farmer is very critical to the success of that mission and what id like to do is just before i finish, id like to ask zippy to come up and say a couple of words, because he really is at the forefront of so much of what we do.    so zippy duvall, come on up.    thats true. thats true.    thank you very much. thanks zippy. thats true. four and a half years ago, i called zippy, never spoke to him and he liked me. i liked him and i dont know, i got good support right from the beginning, but weve come through.    weve come through. absolutely. shes a great woman. great woman. thank you very much zippy. so just to conclude, american farmers, ranchers, and growers feed fuel and sustain our nation. theyre proud defenders of the american way of life, and im proud to stand right by their side in this hour of need. and the food chains are now back to almost working perfectly again. they had some interruptions which you knew about, and we were able to take a very bold action, you saw that. and that action caused them to do what they had to do. and they were in good shape, and very shortly therell be an absolutely perfect shape, but people were worried about that. the action we took was a very important action, larry kudlow, wasnt it? we did a good job. now id like to ask secretary perdue to say a few words followed by ivanka and marty smith, if i could. okay? please, please.    thank you.    thank you. marty?    thank you very much. thank you. okay, any questions real quick?    im going to capitol hill [inaudible 00:26:58].    do you want to answer that question, sir?    and thats being looked at separately.    well, i think we just want people in this country to be healthy. how does every country address it? we want our people to be healthy. we want them to be happy and we want them to have all of the benefits that you could have including great healthcare. the republican party has been very strong on healthcare, as you know, and that includes preexisting conditions. and we have done a terrific job on healthcare. then we got hit by a plague like nobodys ever seen before, outside of maybe 1917. and i think weve done an incredible job in producing ventilators and producing testing. right now, you probably saw the numbers were over 12 million tests. thats three times more, four times more than any other country in the world. and were talking about countries that have done a good job. nobodys done testing like us. plus we have the highest quality test. so very simply we want our people to be healthy. [crosstalk 00:28:53]    sure, we want to give people great food. and thats one of the reasons we have our farmers and ranchers involved.    well, its a relatively small number. actually, i heard sonny speaking about it yesterday. its a very small number, but its still cattle coming in. we have tremendous amounts of supply cattle and all, but generally speaking, supply. tremendous supply, our farmers have done an incredible job. and now the distribution is being made much better than it has been and better. i think it will end up being much better than its ever been, [zippy. 00:00:29:38].    but im saying, why are we bringing in cattle? all trade deals that were made a long time ago, why are we bringing in cattle from other countries when we have so much ourselves? now, in some cases, i thought your answer was very good. theyve been great allies. theyve been working with us for many years. sometimes we needed the cattle and sometimes we dont. thats the farming business, but i would say generally speaking, unless this is a country that really has been with us, we shouldnt be taking their cattle. you know that. okay? and thats the way were going to handle it.    i dont want to go through it. the letter is a very detailed, long letter. but basically they have to clean up their act. they have to do a better job. they have to be much more fair to other countries, including the united states. so were not going to be involved with them anymore. well do in a separate way. okay? [crosstalk 00:30:29]    ive been very much involved with plants since this problem came up and theyve done a lot in terms of shields and other things, but they had a disproportionately high number of people that had the problem and thats going away. the plants are very, very clean now. and theyre getting to a level where i think we had a report that theyre cleaner than theyve ever been. thats a good report, but i dont know exactly what that means, but they are cleaner than theyve ever been. theyre doing a very good job, i think, right now in terms of the production act and in terms of what were enforcing. but the meat packing plants are coming online. many of them are online and fewer and fewer problems and being seen. if we didnt act, we would have had a big problem. if somebody who was in this position, that didnt act, we would have had a big problem, but its something that we were very much involved in because we saw it very early. okay. did you have a question?    us/canada?    were dealing with, the prime minister is a friend of ours, and were very close to canada. we just signed the usmca, which is a big deal. and its with mexico and with canada. and were dealing on that subject. and were also, on the southern border, as you know, the wall is going up, its going up very rapidly. were at 182 miles. wherever we have the wall, its just ended. it just ended people coming into our country illegally. were stopping drug traffic, were stopping trafficking and people, mostly women, because they traffic mostly women, unfortunately. its a tremendously big business. its a horrible business and were stopping it. its a worldwide problem. this isnt a problem for our southern border, but our southern border is a big point. and were stopping trafficking. the wall has had an incredible power and strength on what were doing. i have to say that, so well have by pretty early next year, well have 450 to 500 miles of wall fully built. so were doing a great job on the border.    we have among the lowest numbers weve ever had of people coming in and were moving them out as soon as they come in. as they come in, were moving them out. literally were moving them out immediately and thats never taken place before. meaning in the last, in modern history, its never taken out, never taken-    for now, yes. but were talking to canada. as things clean up in terms of the plague, were both going to want to do the normal. everything we want to get back to normal. i think were going to have a fantastic year next year. i think we will do very well in the fourth quarter. and i think the transition quarter, which is coming up, were starting at very shortly, the third quarter. i think youll see some very good numbers, but youre going to see some great numbers in the fourth quarter. and youre going to end up doing a great year next year. you can see it. look at the states that are opening up. theyre busy and their numbers, interestingly, going down. so theyre opening up. you look at florida and georgia in particular, their numbers are going down. so, were very confident that were going to have a tremendous, tremendous turnaround. and we had to turn it off artificially, and now were turning it back on and youre going to see some tremendous numbers. thank you very much. im going over to capitol hill.    thank you. and i just heard, youre going to be having 2,000 more jobs right down the road for the bronco, which is a big winner. thats great. fantastic job. thank you very much, bill.    thank you. thank you, right down the road. its an honor to have bill with us. thank you very much. and im thrilled to be back in michigan. weve done a lot of work in michigan. a lot of plants are opening. a lot of plants stopped... we stopped them from closing and we kept your workers here in michigan and in the united states, different places as you know, all over the united states, but its an honor to do.    its one of the reasons im standing here. in fact years ago, i was honored long before i ever thought of the presidential situation. i was honored in michigan and i said, how come youre losing so much of your car business to mexico and other places? and i asked that question very innocently. it was probably 10 years ago. the man of the year, they named me man of the year in michigan. and i said, whats going on in michigan? and weve stopped it. and thanks to a lot of great companies like ford, a lot of things are happening here. and its why im so honored when bill mentioned the plant that youre going to be doing 2,000 and its also a great success, the broncos. so thats really, really big news. thank you very much. thank you.    im honored to stand on a factory floor operated by the incredible workers of ford motor company. you really are tremendously talented people. i know it. im not sure everybody in the world knows it, but a lot of people do. and theyre all going to know it after this speech, but you are really talented, great people. thank you very much for doing a great job.    we know what it takes. few people have that ability, a few. in our nations war against the invisible enemy, the hardworking patriots here today answered the call to serve. you prove that the american worker is built ford and you are built for tough, a great expression. you still use that expression, i think bill, right? thats a great expression.    lets see. can i use it for maybe myself, built trump tough. i dont know. they may say thats a takeoff. thats no good. you cant do that. and youve made really america proud and youve made ford proud. and america is very proud of ford right here at the roseville component plant. youre building a great medical arsenal to defeat the virus and cement americas place as the leading manufacturer and exporter of ventilators, anywhere in the world. were now getting calls from other countries, many other countries, both friend and foe, believe it or not.    we get calls from foe and we want to help them out too. and were making thousands and thousands of ventilators. and i think we really sort of started right over here. we got a call very early on from bill and the group, and this is incredible whats happened and what youve done. with your help, not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one. and as you remember, we took over empty cupboards. the cupboards were bare and we got into the business of ventilators and testing and all of these other things. now weve done 14 million tests. the second country is at 3 million and less than 3 million, germany, south korea. and theyve done a good job, but were at 14 million tests and the tests are the best of all. but on behalf of our entire nation, i want to say thank you very much.    thank you very much for doing a great job. driven by the love and sweat and devotion of everyone here today, were saving lives. were forging ahead. and as of this week, the beating heart of the american auto industry is back open for business. that started right away. didnt it? it starts right now. and you have all those supply chains coming in. theyre going to come through because if they dont come through, just build a product right here. okay. because you know, that can happen too.    but we heard that. its a big story that were starting with the cars now, and its going to be a big success. in addition to many wonderful uaw workers, were joined by secretary ben carson, whos done a fantastic job. wheres ben? ben is here. thank you, ben. where is he? oh, there he is. hi ben. thank you, ben. thank you. and amanda has done a fantastic job for ford. although, ill ask bill about this later. ill just find out, i want to make sure for myself, but i know based on results, i know. ceo jim hackett. jim, thank you very much. the word is yes, jim, the word is great job. great job.    plant manager, angela weathers. angela, thank you very much. thats a big job. thats a big job. you enjoy it? yeah. great job. fantastic. its a big deal. and ge healthcare us ana canada president everett cunningham. thank you, everett. thank you everett.    before going further, let us send our love to all of the families that have been displaced by the flooding near midland. i spoke to your governor this morning and weve sent some tremendously talented people out here. we have fema and we have the army corps of engineers and they can do things that frankly nobody else can do. the army corps of engineers, what they do. so theyre very good at rebuilding dams that are busted or blown up or for whatever reason bad things happen. but americans are praying for central michigan. were going to take care of your problem. the governor and i had a great conversation this morning. and at the appropriate time, ill go and see the area that well be fixing. were going to help you out. we signed a emergency declaration very quickly, very, very quickly. and were going to help you out very quickly also.    in recent months, this state and this country have faced great challenges. here in the detroit area, you were hit hard by the virus. very, very hard in this area. as one people, we hold in our hearts the precious memory of every person that we have lost and weve lost too many. one is too many. we lost too many. it came in from china and it should have been stopped in china. they didnt stop it. they shouldve stopped it. and as one grateful nation we proclaim god bless our healthcare workers. theyve done an incredible job. they like warriors. theyre like warriors. i want to thank all of the nurses and doctors.    because of the virus, ford was forced to stop automobile production for the first time since world war two. thats something, but you did not despair. your company leadership called up the white house and asked the most american of all questions, how can we help? true. i said, thats nice. thats very nice. every one of the workers in this project volunteered to take part in the greatest industrialization and mobilization project that our society has done, the american people have done in our lifetimes. the company founded by a man named henry ford. good bloodlines, good blood lines. if you believe in that stuff, you get good blood. they teamed up with the company founded by thomas edison. thats general electric. thats good stuff. thats good stuff. and you put it all together. that theyre all looking down right now. and theyd be very proud of what they see. you began the production of 50,000 lifesaving ventilators. a number that if you go back just two months, i would say most people would say it would be impossible to believe. the media is back there. and they would have said a couple of months ago, the creation of that many ventilators would have been not a possible thing.    every single one of these ventilators is made in the usa with american heart, american hands, and american pride. just as your great grandparents produced more than one model t every minute, just as your grandmothers and grandfathers produced a b24, you did the b24 bombers. i saw pictures in the back. that was quite a weapon. that was quite an incredible weapon, b24 bomber.    and just as a ford f150 normally drives off the line every 52 seconds, you quickly mastered this complex new machine of ventilators. theyre a very complicated, delicate, big, expensive machine. one month ago, ford had never built a single ventilator. and now youre a world leader. thats not bad. you adopted the designs of a company that was building just 10 a week, but a very high quality ventilator. and very soon youll be producing one new ventilator every single minute. its an absolute amazing achievement. and youre really helping now beyond the country. youre helping other countries throughout the world. we have 188 countries that are fighting this terrible enemy and ventilators is something they could never... you could do cotton swabs. you can do all of the things, you could even do testing, but ventilators are a whole different lot. its very tough. great job.    ... different lot. its very tough. great job. thanks to you, well stockpile over 100,000 new ventilators in the next few months, and have offered over 14,000 to friends and allies all around the world, and they desperately need them. just this week, i spoke to five countries. they called me. is it possible to get ventilators to them, and im sending them over. i want to recognize just a few of the exceptional americans who made this historic feat possible. keith pastorino is an electrician here in rawsonville. keith, please tell us what youve done. how you like it. come on up. lets see keith. oh, look at keith. thank you keith. love to grab him and shake his hand, but i guess we cant do that, can you.    thank you very much keith. thank you. thank you. great job. great people. were also joined by gary brabant, a quality technician. gary come on up, gary. thanks gary.    thank you very much. thank you gary. thank you, gary, very much. with us as well is adrian price, who has helped lead this effort as one of fords top engineers, highly respected. come on up please adrian.    thank you. thank you.    i bought plenty of them. i bought plenty of them. thank you adrian. yep. i have a lot of those lincolns. thats great. thank you very much. the global pandemic has proven once and for all that to be a strong nation america must be a manufacturing nation. we are bringing it back, 600,000 jobs. previous administration said, manufacturing jobs, were not doing that. its gone from this country. they were wrong. six hundred thousand jobs until we had to turn it off, and now were going to turn it back on like never before. youll see numbers that you didnt even see the last time. were going to rebuild it quickly. its going to happen very quickly. were already seeing indications of that. larry kudlow gave some numbers that were really inspiring this morning, based on what were hearing and seeing.    true national independence requires economic independence from day one. ive been fighting to bring back our jobs from china, and many other countries. today im declaring a simple but vital national goal. the united states will be the worlds premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. were bringing our medicines back, and many other things too. we must produce critical equipment, supplies, pharmaceuticals, technologies, for ourselves. we cannot rely on foreign nations to take care of us, especially in times of difficulty. in previous decades, politicians shipped away our jobs, outsourced our supply chains, and offshored our industries. they sent them abroad. were bringing them back, and weve been doing that long before this crisis. were bringing them back. thats why we have so many plants being built all over the united states that make a beautiful product called cars. bringing them back. you see it. i told prime minister abe of japan,  shinzo, you got to get them back. we have many japanese companies now building car companies here. i said, youve got to bring them back. weve had deficits with all of these countries for years, and years, and years. they were ripping us left and right. we had no idea. we had no leader that understood what the hell was happening, but now you do.    i said, you got to bring them back. we made a great deal with south korea. we made a great deal with japan. we have $40 billion dollars japan is putting into the united states, not to mention all of the plants that theyre building. the south korea deal was a terrible deal, and we made it good. hillary clinton actually made that deal. she said, its going to produce 250,000 jobs, and she was right. it produced 250,000 jobs for south korea, not for us. wasnt too good was it? but we are bringing it all back to our country, and it started long before this happened. maybe thats one of the reasons this happened. maybe people werent so thrilled with what was going on. but we had the greatest year in the history of our country, and have it again very soon.    in this administration, we know that it matters where someone works on something, and where something is made. as weve seen today, companies like your great ford, and workers like you are a national treasure. i consider ford to be a national treasure. i consider you to be a national treasure, the talent, because that talent, and culture, and commitment to winning, are irreplaceable. your patriotism can not be outsourced. your 117 years of incredible manufacturing heritage cannot be replicated anywhere else in the world. the talent, i see the talent. i know what talent is. i understand your world, and i understand your business. thats why in my administration, we live by two simple rules, buy american and hire american.    buy american and hire american. and we have another rule that you may have heard on occasion. its called america first. we didnt have america first. we had america last under previous presidents. they were more concerned with the world than they were concerned with their own country. my first week in office, i withdrew from the job wrecking trans pacific partnership, which would have destroyed the auto industry. i never asked you about that bill. i mean, i think you agree. oh, you do? would you please stand up and just not that you agree? your industry bill would have been destroyed had that deal gone through and not only yours by the way, but other countries would have been very happy. so i dont know. i dont know how to hell these unions arent endorsing trump instead of the standard democrat. a democrat that doesnt even know where he is.    we renegotiated the catastrophic deal with south korea to preserve the protective tariff on foreign made pickup trucks. the chicken tax, they call it, right? you know what the chicken tax is? most profitable thing you have. you know why? because of the chicken tax that was expiring a year ago, and i got it extended. because of that tax, its one of the most profitable products. you live for that product, right? i kept my promise to replace the nafta disaster with a brand new usmca, which is a fantastic deal for our country. tough new requirements under the usmca ensure more cars to be built in american plants by american labor and even labor endorsed it. but the big thing is youre losing all your car industry. you werent going to have a car industry left.    now people arent going to be moving back to mexico. theyre not going to be moving back and youre going to have it the other way. at the same time we preserve our relationship. mexicos actually been very nice. our border is the strongest its ever been. were up to over 200 miles at brand new, beautiful border wall. and that 200 miles is pristine. nobody comes through. this is a serious wall. its a serious wall. and its incredible what weve done there, too. we had among the best months weve ever had. and now when somebody comes across, we bring them back. we dont go through five years of litigation in the other days or the older days. not so long ago, if they stepped a foot into our country, you had to be perry mason. you end up in a court case and it took years. youd release them into the country by law. and then you say, come back in five years for your trial. and only the very stupid people came back. about 2%. they didnt come back. why should they come back? they were released into our country. we dont do that. we dont do that. and we want people coming into our country, but we want them to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally. its very important. ill continue to fight for us auto workers as we rebuild our economic strength. our strategy for a phased and responsible reopening protects those lives, those american lives, those high risk american lives from the virus while allowing those at loris, such as young, healthy people, where they just have a much, much lower risk. weve learned a lot. youre a certain age, you have a problem with diabetes, or you have a problem with your heart, youre a prime suspect for this horrible disease. its a terrible thing.    so weve learned that young people do very well. very well, incredibly well. older people, especially older people that have problems, they dont do well at all. so we have to protect those people and we want to get everybody now safely back to work. and were going to do that. i spoke today about our churches. our churches have closed. and i said to cdc, i had a great conversation. i said, our people want to go back to church on sundays. and our churches want to take care of their parishioners, their people that go to worship. and a youre going to see something come out very soon about opening up our churches.    a permanent lockdown is not a strategy for a healthy state or a healthy country. our country wasnt meant to be shut down. we did the right thing, but now its time to open it up. a never ending lock down would invite a public health calamity. to protect the health of our people, we must have a functioning economy. and as i said, and ill say it a hundred times, were going to have an incredible year next year, right at the beginning, even our fourth quarter is going to be very good. theres a tremendous pent up demand. that includes for your cars. americans who need and want to return to work should not be vilified. they should be supported unlike many politicians and journalists. for those who earn a living with their own two hands, working remotely is just not an option. you dont have the option of doing that.    our plan emphasizes safety and protection for returning employees. i want to commend ford along with general motors, general electric, fiat chrysler, and so many other companies. a lot of them in this area for blazing, a trail to safely restart americas economic engines. you are demonstrating that we can open our country while taking precautions like social distancing, daily medical screenings, strict hygiene. you can get tremendous numbers of very quick temperature checks. whoever heard they aim a camera right there and two seconds later, they tell you your temperature. more accurately than the old days where you put it under your tongue for two and a half minutes. this is a little better. but you get temperature checks.    and i want to thank you all for leading america back to work. you look at states like florida, georgia, and many others where the numbers have actually gone down. theyre open, but their numbers are going down and very substantially down. with your help and our policies, this country is poised for an epic comeback. this is going to be an incredible comeback. watch, its already happening. within the next year, we are going to be exceeding any expectation and ive had a good gut feeling about a lot of things, including running for president. i said, i think i could win. and i guess i was right. everyone here today, and by the way, i think were going to do better the second time. and its very important that we win the second time or everything that weve done, including manufacturing, jobs, all this is going to be not in a very good position.    everyone here today is the heir to a majestic and noble tradition. you walk in the footsteps of those who built the motor city in the 1920s and thirties, who stocked the arsenal of democracy in the 1940s, and who set the standard for automotive safety and style in the 1950s and sixties and beyond. and even today, bill was showing me some of those cars, its a credible. i wanted to buy one, then i heard the price. i said, forget it. i said, ill use one on occasion, right? but what a car that is, huh? what a car.    our friends and allies marveled at these triumphs of american industry and our enemies learned that nothing can stop the strength and power and grit of the american worker, nothing. just like generations of michigan manufacturers before you, each of you has done your best for america in its time of need. you love your country. you love your country so much. now you have a critical role to play in forging a new legacy of american greatness that will inspire and endure for generations to come. its a very important time in our countrys history and our countrys life. because of you, the ford name will forever stand as a symbol of american excellence, innovation, quality, and craftsmanship. and because of you, america will be strong and healthy and prosperous and free for many, many decades to come.    i want to say very powerfully, very strongly, god bless you all. god bless america. im proud to be here. im proud to be with ford. bill, thank you very much. everyone, thank you very much. well be back. well see you a lot. good luck. john james, thank you for being here. were going to have a great senator, john james. thank you all very much. thank you. thank you.   utah and omaha beaches. every coastguardsman is trusted to put service before all. coasties plunge from helicopters and barrel through pouring rain and crashing waves to save american lives. they secure our borders from drug runners and terrorists in rough seas at high speeds. their sharpshooters take out smugglers engines with a single shot. they never miss. when the red racing stripes of a coast guard vessel break the horizon, when their chopper blades pierce the sky, those in distress know that the help is on their way and our enemies know their time has come.    these guardians of our waters stand: semper paratus. they are always ready. they are the united states coast guard. representing the coast guard today, you will soon see an hh60 jayhawk helicopter based at coast guard air station clearwater along with an hh65 dolphin from air station atlantic city and an hc144 ocean century from air station miami.    thank you. thank you to the coast guard. on a cold december morning in 1903, a miracle occurred over the dunes of kitty hawk, north carolina when two bicycle makers from ohio defied gravity with a 12-horsepower engine, wings made of cotton and just a few dollars in their pockets. just six years later, america was training its first pilots to take these magnificent machines up and over the field of battle. in world war i, our fly boys rushed the skies of europe and aces like eddie rickenbacker filled hearts and headlines with tales of daring duels in the clouds. general billy mitchell saw the promise of this technology and risked court martial in his quest for an independent air force. he was proven right when empires across the oceans tried to carve up the world for themselves and america stood in the way. we wouldnt let it happen.    after pearl harbor, lieutenant colonel james doolittle and his raiders flew b-25 bombers off a carrier deck in the deep pacific in a daring feat of american resolve. and as president roosevelt said, the nazis built a fortress around europe, but they forgot to put a roof on it. so we crushed them all from the air. 177 liberator bombers flew dangerously low through broad daylight without fighter protection to cripple the nazi war machine at [inaudible 00:00:05:00]. more than 300 airmen gave their lives to destroy the enemy oil refineries and five pilots were awarded the congressional medal of honor for their actions in that single raid. it was airman, chuck yeager who first broke the sound barrier. it was airman like gus grissom and buzz aldrin, who traded their saber jets for rockets to the stars. and it is our incredible airmen today who wield the most powerful weapon systems on the planet earth. for over 65 years, no enemy air force has managed to kill a single american soldier because the skies belong to the united states of america.    no enemy has attacked our people without being met by a roar of thunder. and the awesome might of those who bid farewell to earth and soar into the wild blue yonder. they are the united states air force. representing the air force, you will soon see beautiful brand new f-22 raptors from langley air force base in virginia. and one magnificent b-2 stealth bomber from whiteman air force base in missouri.    what a great country. in october of 1775, the continental congress ordered the construction of two swift sailing vessels, each carrying 10 cannons and 80 men to sail eastward. our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful navy the world has ever seen. john paul jones, americas first great naval hero, said i wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for i intend to go in harms way. he got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of england by a british vessel and her four dozen guns. when demanded to surrender, jones very famously declared i have not yet begun to fight.    when our navy begins fighting, they finish the job. the war of 1812, captain james lawrence fell with his brothers on the uss chesapeake. his dying command gained immortality. dont give up the ship. in the battle of mobile bay, admiral david farragut lashed himself to the rigging of his flagship to see beyond the cannon smoke crying, damn the torpedoes. full speed ahead. in world war ii, it was aviators launched from the carrier enterprise, hornet, yorktown, who filled the skies of midway and turned the tide of the pacific war. nobody could beat us. nobody could come close. on d-day, cb engineers came ashore to destroy blockades and barriers making way for the invasion. many lost their lives, but they took the german defenses with them and our men crushed upon the beaches like a mighty storm. from the naval demolition units of world war ii arose a force that became famous in the [meit 00:10:44] kang delta. they dont want to see our force again. the very best of the very best, the navy seals.    it was the seals who delivered vengeance on the terrorists who planned the september 11th attack on our homeland. it was the seals who stand ready to bring righteous retribution in mountain jungle desert to those who do us harm. america sailors are not born. they are forged by the sea. their traditions are rich with the salt and blood of three centuries. when old laurie crest the waves of foreign shores, every friend and every foe knows that justice sails those waters. it sails with the united states navy. representing our great navy today will be two f-18 super hornets from naval air station oceana in virginia, along with two f-35 lightnings from naval air station lemoore in california.    so great. in november of 1775, the continental congress created two battalions of a new kind of warrior. one who kept and would protect our ships and sailors and be at home, both ashore and in the mast with musket in hand. their versatility was proven in the war of independence when 234 continental marines conducted their first amphibious raid, capturing the british supply of gunpowder and cannons at fort nassau. ever since, marines have fought in every american war. their legend has grown and grown and grown with each passing year. it was the marines who won americas first overseas battle, vanquishing barbary pirates on the shores of tripoli. their high stiff collar, which shielded them from the pirate sword, earned them the immortal name leatherneck. it was the marines, who after two long days of battle, march through the halls of montezuma. it was the marines who took heavy casualties to kick the kaisers troops out of belleau wood in world war one, earning the title devil dogs. and it was the marines who raised the flag on the black sands of iwo jima. from the chosin reservoir to kaesong, from helmond to baghdad, marines have struck fear into the hearts of our enemies and put solace into the hearts of our friends. marines always lead the way. after the 1983 marine barracks bombing in beirut, which claimed the lives of 241 great us servicemen, marine sergeant jeffery nashton lay in bandages so badly wounded, barely alive. when the commandant of the marine corps came to visit his hospital, sergeant nashton had to feel for the generals collar. he wanted to feel his four stars. he could not see and he could not speak. he signaled for pen and paper. and with shaking hand, he wrote two words: semper fi. that motto, semper fidelis, always faithful, burns in the soul of every marine a sacred promise the core has kept since the birth of our country. they are the elite masters of air and land and sea on battlefields all across the globe. they are the united states ...    all across the globe. they are the united states marines.    representing the marine corps today will be a brand new vh-92, soon to serve as marine one, along with two v-22 ospreys from the famed hmx-1 helicopter squadron at quantico, the night hawks.    (singing)    in june of 1775, the continental congress created a unified army out of the revolutionary forces encamped around boston and new york and named after the great george washington, commander-in-chief. the continental army suffered a bitter winter of valley forge, found glory across the waters of the delaware, and seized victory from cornwallis of yorktown.    our army manned the [inaudible 00:18:27], it [inaudible 00:18:28] the ramparts. it took over the airports. it did everything it had to do. and at fort mchenry, under the rockets red glare, it had nothing but victory. and when dawn came, their star-spangled banner waved defiant. at shiloh, antietam, and gettysburg, our soldiers gave the last full measure of devotion for the true unity of our nation and the freedom of all americans.    in the trenches of world war one, an army sergeant named alvin york, faced an inferno of enemy fire and refused to retreat. he said, i wont leave. i wont stop. he shot his rifle 18 times, killing 18 of the enemy. when they fixed bayonets and charged, he killed seven more. the entire german machine gun battalion surrendered because of one man, alvin york.    a generation later, the army returned to europe and embarked upon a great crusade with knives and rifles in hand. the rangers scaled the cliffs of normandy. the 101st airborne leapt into the danger from above, illuminated only by enemy flares, explosions, and burning aircraft. they threw back the nazi empire with lightning of their own from the turrets of sherman tanks and the barrels of the m1 rifle. in the darkness of the battle of the bulge, with nazis on every side, one soldier is reported to have said, theyve got us surrounded again, the poor bastards. yes. outnumbered, american warriors fought through the bunkers of pork chop hill and held the line of civilization in korea. in the elephant grass of vietnam, the first cavalry made its stand amid a forest consumed in flame with enemies at every single turn. the army brought americas righteous fury down to al-qaeda in afghanistan and cleared the bloodthirsty killers from their caves. they liberated fallujah and mosul and helped liberate and obliterate the isis caliphate just recently in syria, 100% gone. through centuries, our soldiers have always pointed toward home proclaiming, this well defend. they live by the creed of douglas macarthur. in war, there is no substitute for victory. they are the greatest soldiers on earth.    (singing)    nearly 250 years ago, a volunteer army of farmers and shopkeepers, blacksmiths, merchants, and militiamen risked life and limb to secure american liberty and self-government. this evening, we have witnessed the noble might of the warriors who continue that legacy. they guard our birthright with vigilance and fierce devotion to the flag and to our great country. now we must go forward as a nation with that same unity of purpose. as long as we stay true to our course, as long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that america cannot do.    thank you. we will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed a continent, harnessed science, took to the skies, and soared into the heavens, because we will never forget that we are americans, and the future belongs to us.    the future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free. we are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny. we all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty god.    from the banks of the chesapeake to the cliffs of california, from the humming shores of the great lakes to the sand dunes of the carolinas, from the fields of the heartland to the everglades of florida, the spirit of american independence will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever.    so once more, to every citizen throughout our land, have a glorious independence day. have a great fourth of july. i want to thank the army band, the national park service, the interior department, the incredible pilots overhead, and those who are making possible the amazing fireworks display later this evening. now as the band plays the battle hymn of the republic, i invite the first lady, vice president and mrs. pence, the service secretaries, and military leaders to join me on stage for one more salute to america by the famous, incredible, talented blue angels. god bless you, god bless the military, and god bless america. happy fourth of july.   thank you very much. thank you. thank you. its a great honor to have you at the white house, a very special place. beautiful and so meaningful in so many ways and our country has never done better. youre all doing really well. every state is doing well. i can say most every state in the room today is setting records and wed like to think that the federal government has been helping you a lot, but it is wonderful being with you and we had a great evening last night, and the talent of those musicians, they could be anywhere in the world. many of them could work in the great opera houses, but they loved the military.    when you heard the violins and the talent, the great talent, i dont know if anybody has an ear for music. believe it or not, a long time ago, i was told i have a great ear for music by somebody. i took a test. they said, he has a wonderful aptitude for music. i said, i do? but would you listen to that? its really incredible, the talent, and theyre great people. they want to be in the military. they dont want to be anywhere else. so its really, really something.    as i said in my state of the union last week, were in the midst of a great american comeback with the help of many of the people in this room, and youve done really a fantastic job. i think i can say just about everybody. ill say just about just in case some day somebodys going to run or do something that i wont like and i can have a little bit of an out when i say just about. i said, no, he was included in the just about. but were creating the most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society ever to exist, actually.    since my election, americas gained seven million new jobs. we added 225,000 jobs in january alone, crushing expectations. the unemployment rate reached the lowest level in 50 years, and a statistic thats incredible to me is the average unemployment that weve had during this three-year period is the lowest of the history of our country compared to any other administration. the lowest of the history of our country. the unemployment rate for african-american, hispanic-american and asian-americans have reached the lowest level ever recorded.    low income workers have seen a 16% pay increase since my election. something thats so great to see. when i campaigned, they hadnt had rate increases, pay increases, for 20 years, 21 years. they were working three jobs and two jobs and making less money than theyd been made 20 years ago. median household income, as you all know very well, is the highest ever recorded by far. since 2016, 28 states have reached or matched their lowest unemployment rate on record. so we have 28 and i think soon were going to have just about everybody.    and at the end of last year, a record 39 states had unemployment below 4%. again, another record. just as i promised during my campaign, were fighting every day to expand opportunity for african-american communities all across our country. african-american youth, we have such great news on african-american youth. unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded. its a great statistic. african-american poverty rates have plummeted to their lowest rate ever in history and wages for african-american workers have increased $2,400 a year. thats also a record.    at the center of our economic agenda, or opportunity zones, i hope youre embracing them. i think many of you are. my administration has worked with the governors in this room to create nearly 9,000 opportunity zones in our most vulnerable communities. jobs and money are pouring into these areas that have never seen investment. i mean, they havent seen them in decades and decades and decades, and hundreds of millions of dollars are pouring into certain communities, individual communities, hundreds of millions of dollars. and its never been anything like it. opportunity zones. tim scott did a great job on that. senator tim scott.    i urge all governors to create a state-level version of our white house opportunity and revitalization council to coordinate the efforts of state government to provide maximum support for the opportunities and say, were there to help you. if you have a problem, call me, literally call me and well work it out. but the opportunity zones, and thats democrat or republican, by the way, opportunities have been fantastic. we must not stop until we have delivered equal and abundant opportunity for every community in our land, and thats whats happening. to give former prisoners a second chance.    this has worked better than any program, ever. i was proud to sign the landmark criminal justice reform into law, and since that time, 10 states have passed legislation following our lead and there were numerous states, i know texas was there, governor with criminal justice reform. amazing. and kentucky and few others that were thought of as being very strict states, and yet they had criminal justice reform. we looked at a lot of what texas did and some of the other states, what worked so well. alice johnson is an example. she was in for 22 years and she had another 20 years to serve on something that everythings bad, but to be in jail for 40 and 50 years for what alice did on a telephone was crazy.    thanks to our roaring economy, former inmates are now finding jobs and the employers are so happy now. the economy is really helping, but its the first time ever were prisoners coming out of jail are finding jobs, loving it, and the employers, the feedback were getting from so many people, so many employers are, these are among the best people they have and they were in a way forced by the economy, the good economy, because its hard to get people. down to 3.5, and actually, it went to 3.6 because were opening up the valve, theyre hiring more and more people.    there was a positive, 225,000 as i said, but the prisoners are now working and theyre doing a phenomenal job, for the most part. our booming prosperity is being fueled by our historic regulatory reduction campaign and my first month in office, i imposed a two-for-one rule requiring for every one new regulation, two old ones must be eliminated. well, that turned out to be ... we went to four, we went to six, we went to eight. we had a period where we were at 22:1, 22:1, and were eliminating on average $3,100 in regulation cost per family a year. nobodys ever even heard of such a thing, and were getting housing bill, too.    we have rules and regulations, made it impossible. i hope california gets their act together because the cost of regulations is almost the cost of a house and they need housing and they cant build it. they dont know what theyre doing. the governors initiative or regulatory innovation is designed to continue our unprecedented progress through straight estate level deregulation. governor doug ducey has achieved three for one on cuts ... wheres doug? good job, doug. well, he only won by about 17%, so, you know, he should be doing good. in fact, at 17%, you should be at 4:1, i think, right? thats a big win, big one. that was a great win.    and governor kevin stitt of oklahoma has reached two for one and going to three for one. wheres kevin? hi, kevin. good job. great. were also working together ... and many of you in the room have done much better than one-for-one, much better. some of you are up to four. were also working together to reform occupational licensing. just this year at least 12 governors have taken action to reduce burdensome occupational licensing requirements. that means licensing where either its unnecessary, or where you actually can do it very quickly.    there are some licensing requirements that takes years to get approved and it could take a matter of days, could take a matter of days. governors understand the need to get infrastructure projects quickly approved to speed up permitting and reduced traffic congestion. last month, we issued a proposed new rule to reduce permitting and the permitting time for new infrastructure by more than 70%. highways that were taking 12 years to get approved, 14, 15, 17, 21 years. were trying to get it down to one year.    that means you may get rejected if you have an environmental problem or safety problem. in many cases, these highways became much more unsafe and they took a long time because they try and get away from certain problems, including nesting, but they try and get away and instead of having a straight run, theyd create curves in the highway, which obviously, make it much more dangerous. and they had problems with some of those highways and theyre much more expensive to build.    not only the time, the design, but the time. i mean, by the time they get an approved. so, we have highways that would take 21 years. we have roads that took 10 years, 11 years, 12 years to get approved. and elaine chao has been fantastic. elaine, thank you very much. the job youre doing with transportation, we appreciate it very much. and jeff, you were over there for a long while. i will tell you, so i have to give you at least partial credit. right now, youre at a different location, but you really did. you did a great job on that.    so we have it down to two years now, but i think were going to get it down to one and very good chance youll be rejected if it doesnt meet environmental standards and tests. and we are rescuing students from failing government schools by introducing the education, freedom, scholarships and opportunity act, which will replicate the great success of tax credit scholarships available in 18 states. we believe very strongly, or at least many of the people in this room, not all of them, but believe very strongly in school choice. were also working closely with the states to improve public safety.    this includes the incredible work being done by our nations heroic ice officers. weve moved thousands of ms-13 out of the country back to where they came from, whether its guatemala, honduras, el salvador, mexico. and as you know, we reached agreements with those countries so that we can do that. and the past administration, they wouldnt accept them. they come from one of the countries, tough countries, and we would send them back and they wouldnt take them. not me. they take them now. now they say, thank you so much for sending them back. we were looking for this killer. thank you very much. we appreciate it.    but they all take them now. they take them very quickly before they used to say, dont ever even think about landing that airplane. we dont want those people. so they take them back rapidly. some day, theyll tell the real story as to why, but thats the way it has to be. we have thousands and thousands of killers and gang members that were bringing back to countries that now accept them. they were not taking them back. last year alone, ice officers arrested 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.    now, some of them we keep here when they ... its very egregious. we dont necessarily trust other people to take care of justice, so we keep them here. but we dont like having people in our prisons for 50 years, 60 years, and we have to pay for it. and so, for the most part, we bring them back to their countries and give them a very bad recommendation. state and local cooperation is the backbone of this effort. we have a tremendous relationship with-    it is the backbone of this effort. we have a tremendous relationship with many of the states and governments, cities. its essential that all of our states and cities honor ice detainer requests to ensure that safe transfer of criminal aliens into federal custody takes place. jurisdictions that adopt sanctuary policies and instead release these criminals, put all of americans in harms way. a very, very serious problem. i mean were all here for the same thing. i know we have different policies, different feelings, different everything, but sanctuary cities are causing us a tremendous problem in this country. we have stone cold killers that they dont want to hand over to us and then they escape into communities and they cause in some cases tremendous havoc.    another vital element of federal and state cooperation is the relentless fight against opioids and the drug epidemic. weve had great progress. were down 1819 and 20% in some of the communities. first ladys been very much involved in that. kellyanne has been very much involved in that. a lot of the people in this room, almost everybody in this room has been involved in it. and i want to thank you for that. were making progress. very tough, all over the world. this is a problem all over the world. this is big problem here, but its a big problem almost everywhere.    for the first time in three decades, weve achieved a decline in drug overdose deaths, including as an example, ohio. mike is around here someplace. mike. mike, mike, 23% in ohio. 19% in pennsylvania. 10% in wisconsin, and were averaging probably about 16, 17%, so its been... its not enough, but were making a lot of progress and if we had more help in congress, we could get it even lower.    my administration is truly grateful for the leadership, cooperation, partnership, and friendship of the governors in this room. no matter our party, we must work together and really do the job and i think thats whats happening. our country is now receiving thousands and thousands of companies that are coming into the united states. some had left and some had never been here before, but they all want to be where the action is. we lost 60,000 plants and factories over the year, 60,000. its hard to even conceive and weve got many of them back and many are coming back and theyre moving to a lot of your states. i know a lot of them are coming into texas and florida and a lot of different locations. south carolina, north carolina, pennsylvania. its incredible whats happening. ohio is a big beneficiary.    michigan is a tremendous beneficiary with the car companies, tremendous. somebody was saying theyre so happy in michigan. and i meet with a prime minister abe of japan. i say, shinzo you have to get more car companies here. we have a deficit with you. you have to get them in. and they are. theyre sending a lot of companies. we hadnt built a plant in years and years, in decades frankly. and now we have car plants being built all over the united states and we have expansions, a lot of expansions of existing plants. so its been really an incredible thing.    were doing incredible work and were the number one country in the world right now in terms of the economy. when i was running and long before i was running, id always heard that china, have great respect for president xi and great respect for china frankly, but that china was going to be the number one economy in the world during 2019. actually it was 2018, 2019, you all heard it, that we were going to go to number two. and i will tell you we had our battle and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and other things and you saw the... it was just announced, the trade deficit was the lowest its been in years with china. just happened two days ago. they just announced. but we are now so far ahead of china in terms of the size of our economy that if somebody is smart thats at this position for times into the future, hopefully after five years, i wont joke by saying 9, 13, 15 it drives them crazy. for the governors it drives them... even when i joke, it drives them crazy. so i wont say that.    but if somebody smart is in this position, itll never happen, which i know over texas, itll never happen. so we right now have... were so far ahead of them. theyre not catching us for a long time. if the wrong person stands here or sits in the white house, that beautiful chair in the white house, in the oval office, sure theyre going to catch you. they have 1.5 billion people. we have 350 million people, but we have a very special place and a very special country and nobodys going to catch us if we have great leadership. and you have been great leaders for your states and we appreciate very much that youre at the white house. thank you very much.    so what were going to do is i thought maybe we could take a few questions if you want. we could leave the press there. the press would love that, im sure. or we could have them leave and we could talk in a different fashion. you wont have to show boat. so would anybody preference. well leave them here for a little while and then well go a different route perhaps. any questions, please? please.    were doing a big infrastructure potential deal. we need, obviously, we need help from... we need the votes of democrats. theyve been so focused on something else and wasting a lot of peoples time. although my poll numbers have been driven way the hell up, so thats one way to do it i guess. but they have been so focused on the impeachment hoax that they havent had time to do anything else, but were ready to go with a big infrastructure bill, if theyre ready to approve it.    were also ready to lower drug prices very substantially. we did last year was the first time in 51 years that drug prices, prescription drug prices went down first time in 51 years. but to get them really down, we have to do exactly what were doing, where we have... we need the votes of the democrats and they just didnt have the time to do anything. so maybe they will now have the time, but were all ready to go on infrastructure, on reducing drug prices. very substantial. we can reduce drug prices unbelievably easily and substantially, but we have to get democrat votes. okay, thank you. thank you, governor. please.    europe has been treating us very badly. european union was really formed so they could treat us badly, so theyve done their job. that was one of the primary reasons, but they treat us badly there and they treat us badly frankly on nato. but nato ive gotten, as you know, $130 billion more they will pay because nato was going down like a rocket ship. our past leaders would go over and make a speech and leave. i went over, made a speech and said, you got to pay more, because the united states was paying everything. essentially they were paying close to 100% and i let them know you have no choice and they are paying more. they paid 130 billion.    i think my biggest fan of the whole world is secretary general stoltenberg, head of nato. he said he cant believe it, because for 20 years it went down. its like a roller coaster there. no, no... none of this just down. they paid less and less and less and it got more expensive and more expensive with time. but i raised $130 billion my first meeting and i raised 400 billion my second meeting. so now its in good shape. but we were taken advantage of by a lot of countries, a lot of allies frankly. sometimes allies do a better job on you than the enemy, because the enemies you watch out for, right?    so pete, i think that the next thing could be europe where we talk to them very seriously and they have to do it, because theres been, over the last 10 12 years, theres been a tremendous deficit with europe. they have barriers that are incredible. i didnt want to do them while we were doing china, japan, south korea. i didnt want to do the whole world at one time. does that make sense? people have learned that doesnt work out too well, even on trade.    so were going to be starting that. they know that. they know that. theyre ready for it. we made a good deal with japan. were going to do a bigger, much more comprehensive deal, but were taking in 40 billion from japan, which they didnt expect. nobody expected. weve done great on the trade. its going to have a tremendous impact.    now the virus that were talking about having to do... a lot of people think that goes away in april with the heat, as the heat comes in. typically, that will go away at april. were in great shape though. we have 12 cases, 11 cases and many of them are in good shape now. so, but a very good question. yes, please, colorado.    well, we almost had a deal on that with the democrats as you know. it was done. and then we lost a decision and the democrats said, trump, whos that? trump, whos that? but we were very close to having a deal on the dreamers with the house and with the senate, would have been very good deal for everybody. and so were looking at that.    but now were before the supreme court. i think were going to win, because if we dont win, that gives the president of the united states unbelievable powers. president obama signed that bill, it was an executive order. and when he signed that, he said essentially he said, i dont have the right to do this, but im going to do it anyway. and he was upheld by a judge and anyway, itll be before the supreme court pretty soon and at some point i think well probably make a deal on that. i do feel that way. okay, good question. question. yes please. gary. hows mitt romney?    you keep them. we dont want him. go ahead.    doing a great job in utah by the way. go ahead gary.    yeah, i agree.    were putting out a plan today that over a period of... not that long a period of time, brings our budget and our deficit down to what it should be, which is close to zero. and i think people are going to be very impressed by it. were not touching medicare. we want to keep medicare. were not touching social security. were making our country stronger again. were not decreasing medicaid, but were doing a lot of things that are very good, including waste and fraud, tremendous waste and tremendous fraud. so what were doing that, in terms of certain programs. and were taking good care of our military, were increasing spending on our nuclear program, because we have no choice, because of what china is doing, what russia is doing in particular. and so we have a very big number in for that. now, at the same time, russia and china both want to negotiate with us to stop this craziness of spending billions and billions of dollars nuclear weapon.    ... this craziness of spending billions and billions of dollars on nuclear weapons, but the only way until we have that agreement, the only thing i can do is create by far the strongest nuclear force center in the world. which as you know, over the last three years, weve very much upgraded our nuclear, but were buying new, we have the superfast missiles, tremendous number of the superfast. we call them superfast, where theyre four, five, six and even seven times faster than an ordinary missile. we need that because again, russia has some, i wont tell you how they got it. they got it supposedly from plans from the obama administration when we werent doing it. and thats too bad. thats not good. but thats how it happened. and china, as you know, is doing it.    we have a tremendous $740 billion for military. but again, its also jobs in the united states. so its everythings made in the united states proudly. and we have the best in the world. we have the best equipment in the world, the best missiles, planes, rockets. everybody wants our equipment. we have to be very selective obviously, but were going to have a very good budget with a very powerful military budget because we have no choice about that. ron, do you have something about, for instance, your plan of buying and cutting prescription drugs? you want to tell them what were doing?    you can go, and colorado is doing that, also, you can go to certain countries and the exact same pill made in the exact same plant, factory wherever it may be from one of the big companies, will sell for 50%, 60%, 70% less than the united states is paying because its broken. its a broken system. and so one of the things ive authorized is that certain states have requested probably after this, everybody in this room will go back, but, but if we buy from canada, youll save 50% at this moment.    now that may go up or everything may come down. one thing is going to happen or another, either the drug companies are going to raise it and not make it possible to buy. theyre going to raise it in canada, meaning so you wont be able to do it. or everyones going to go down because they have a middleman in the middle of that are making a fortune. nobody knows who these people are, but theyre getting rich because we had a broken system and its about time it gets fixed.    so a lot of shakeup is going to take place, but if we had democrats helping us, we could solve this problem in one day, but they dont want to vote. again, they dont have any time to vote. they dont have any time to do anything other than what they do. so they seem to be freed up a lot now. theyre freed up a lot actually i hear. how about a couple of more and then well let the press go and relax and take it easy. please, governor.    thank you.    yes.    so as you know, its gone down. i met with president xi on the trade deal. and i said, you have to stop fentanyl coming into our country. you have to do me a favor and stop it. you have to get it stopped. it has to end because its a favor for our country and were losing thousands and thousands of people to fentanyl. i mean, the size of a pinhead can kill a lot of people. its unbelievably bad and they send it direct and they sent it through mexico and through the border and we would catch a lot of it, but even if a little bit got through, its a very deadly drug. and they have cut it way back and theyve also criminalized... it wasnt a criminal, they considered a corporate kind of a thing. it was a drug of a different nature and now they put it into their criminal statutes and criminal in china for drugs, by the way, means thats serious. theyre getting a maximum penalty. and you know what the maximum penalty is in china for that and it goes very quickly.    its interesting, where you have singapore, they have very little drug problem. we have china, they have very little drug problem. states with a very powerful death penalty on drug dealers dont have a drug problem. i dont know that our country is ready for that, but if you look throughout the world, the countries with a powerful death penalty, death penalty with a fair but quick trial, they have very little if any drug problem that includes china. but theyve put fentanyl now into there, hes working on that and its gone down a lot as you know. they put it into their penalty system and people will be getting the death penalty in china now for fentanyl. it was a big thing. its not part of the trade agreement, but it is part of the trade agreement. and they have acted on it.    now, of course theyre working on something else and i think theyre doing a good job on that. on the virus. had a long talk with president xi for the people in this room two nights ago and he feels very confident. he feels very confident. and he feels that, again as i mentioned by april or during the month of april, the heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus. so that would be a good thing. but were in great shape in our country. we have 11 and the 11 are getting better. okay, so great question. i think that fentanyl is a huge problem. its almost at this moment to 100% made in china and they are starting to enforce it on our behalf. we have a good relationship with china now. probably the best weve ever had. so i think what well do, any other questions from the governors? yes please.    so we did a big thing on healthcare. we got rid of the individual mandate on obamacare, which basically made obamacare not obamacare anymore. it was the most unpopular thing in obamacare and basically you paid a lot of money for the privilege of not paying to have bad healthcare and nobody wanted that. and we got rid it, big, big move and i had a choice. i can make so it really isnt obamacare anymore but, we do as you know we left preexisting conditions and everything. we left it because preexisting well always have, and i think i can speak for democrats too, but we are all going to have preexisting conditions. we are always going to make sure that thats taken care of, the preexisting condition situation.    i think i can speak, i know i can speak for republicans. i think i can speak for democrats. its a part of our society right down. nobodys going to change it. if a law is overturned, thats okay because the new law is going to have it in the new law would replace the old law that was overturned it would have preexisting conditions. so i think thats important to say. but one thing that we will be doing is, at least from a republican standpoint, you have 180 million people out there that have great health insurance. they love it, private health insurance, and were going to save it.    other people are thinking about terminating it, which is brutal for unions and others. so i dont know how theyre going to get around that, but were going to be saving that. but when i took over, i had a choice. so we got rid of the most unpopular thing in obamacare, almost got rid of obamacare but essentially we did. but now i said, do we run it really well or do we run it really poorly? do we make everybody unhappy and blame the democrats or do we make people relatively happy with a bad law? its a bad law, its bad policy, but do we make people relatively happy. and i chose, i felt i had an obligation to do the latter. so its been working out pretty well and it goes along and weve done block grants, weve done a lot of different things with different states and its tailor made for different states.    we are doing things for states. some people want block grants, some people want something else. and were working with individual states and i think governors are really happy and really surprised that were doing that. i could have just a cold lined it and just said were not doing anything and everybody would be happy. everybody would be complaining. but i think the best thing for our country to do is the way were doing it until we get a replacement for obamacare, a full replacement thats going to be great. and i would say this, if we change the house, if we get the house, the republicans get the house back, we will have that.    otherwise well just have to negotiate with the democrats. and i think at some point theyll come around and start negotiating these things because they really are good. so media, thank you very much we appreciate it and well have a little more discussion. thank you very much.  other related

can tell you, you have never had a better friend as president that president donald trump. that i can tell you. the prime minister knows that. on this day, im happy to report that the relationship between the united states and india is stronger than ever before. the ties between our two nations are grounded in our common values and our shared commitment to democracy. we are free nations with great faith and a fierce devotion to our national independence. we are governed by the rule of law, guided by commitment to justice, and strengthened by our love of liberty. our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words, we the people.    that means that in america amd india alike, we honor, respect, trust, empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve. under prime minister modis leadership, the world is witnessing a strong sovereign and thriving republic of india. in a single decade, with the help of prime minister modis pro-growth reforms, india has lifted nearly 300 million people out of poverty and that is an incredible number. incredible. thats incredible. in the next decade, 140 million indian households will rise to the middle class. in both india and the united states, were seeing something really remarkable. our people are prospering like never before because we are slashing bureaucracy and cutting job killing red tape.    in the united states, thanks to our massive tax cuts and all of our great senators and congressmen and women that are here today and pro worker policies, our economy is breaking one record after another. since my election, we have created over 6 million new jobs. we have created over 750,000 jobs right here in texas and very importantly, that includes 70,000 new texas manufacturing jobs. they said that couldnt be done. unemployment ... think of this. unemployment in texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country, and unemployment in the united states has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number. unemployment among african americans, asian americans, and hispanic americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. over the last two years, the unemployment rate among indian americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent. wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many, many years. in the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken home $1,000 extra in rising wages and over $3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that weve done. and for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women. first time thats ever happened. through our pledge to americas workers, we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for american workers done through our great american companies. we passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country. we slashed a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average american household more than $3,000 every year and never in the history of our country, no matter how long the presidency, have regulations been cut to this extent. everyday, the indian american community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future. indian americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives. theyre developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and theyre founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens. prime minister modi, i look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before. and thats whats happening. the economic miracles taking place today are just beginning. here in the united states, there has never been a better time to hire, invest, grow, and pursue your dreams.    indian companies employ tens of thousands of americans across a range of industries, including american steel. in 2018 indias jsw steel announced that it would invest up to $500 million to revitalize a shuttered steel plant in the great state of ohio. and we welcome indias growing investments right here in the lone star state. nations around the world are investing in the united states because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world. they have never invested in our country like they are today. and we want to thank everybody and india has never invested in the united states like it is doing today. and i want to say its reciprocal because were doing the same thing in india.    on tuesday, two japanese companies, toyota and aisin, announced a combined investment of almost $800 million, which will create over 900 new jobs right here in texas. at the same time, we are working to expand american exports to india, one of the worlds fastest growing markets. we are committed to ensuring the indian people have access to the finest goods in the world, product stamped with a beautiful phrase, made in the usa. and very soon, india will have access to another world class american product, nba basketball. wow, sounds good. that sounds good. next week thousands of people will gather in mumbai to watch the first ever nba basketball game in india. am i invited, mr. prime minister? i may come. be careful. i may come.    when it comes to expanding our commercial relationship, no issue is more important than energy security. for the first time ever, the united states is the number one producer of both oil and natural gas on planet earth and number one by far, with much of it coming right here from the great state of texas. that means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump. yesterday, we were thrilled to hear about the indian company petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of lng per year from the united states, which could lead to billions of dollars of lng exports to india in the coming years. and we have plenty of it. over the last year, crude exports to india have grown by 400% and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers. thank you. these tremendous exports not only expand employment in america, but they increase freedom and security for india.    to keep our nation safe, the united states and india forging an even stronger security partnership. us defense sales to india have also reached $18 billion over the past decade. we make the greatest defense mechanisms and equipment anywhere in the world and india knows that well. were looking forward to concluding several new defense deals very soon. there are a lot of them in the works. here in america, were creating the united states space force and were working closely with india to enhance space cooperation. in november, the united states and india will demonstrate a dramatic progress of our defense relationship, holding the first ever tri-service military exercise between our nations. its called tiger triumph. good name, its a good name. very good name. today, we honor all of the brave american and indian military service members who work together to safeguard our freedom. we stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical islamic terrorism. thank you. both india and the united states also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders. since taking office, my administration has launched a far-reaching effort to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry. we are working hard to ensure that those who would threaten our security are denied admission into our country and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like-    ... country, and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like never before, not even close. were doing it on a daily basis, and well soon be setting records in every one of the aspects of border security. border security is vital to the united states. border security is vital to india. we understand that. we are further taking unprecedented action to finally secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration. i want to thank the president of mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. its been incredible whats taken place in a short period of time. illegal immigration is deeply unfair to millions of wonderful legal immigrants who work hard, pay their taxes, follow our rules, and obey our laws. yet there are those in washington who would raid your healthcare to ... free benefits. they want to fund free benefits to those who enter our country illegally. we dont want to do that. we dont want to do that. because if we dont do it, they wont come.    i will never allow politicians to take away your healthcare or give it to illegal immigrants. my administration believes our first duty is to the highest loyalty of all. we must always be for the american people, whether its african-american, hispanic-american, indian-american. we are going to take care of our citizens first. we are going to take care of our indian-american citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country. we want to build a nation where every family, immigrant and us-born, can live in a safe community with access to great school, work in a job you love, and have the best chance to reach the american dream. we love the american dream.    just in concluding, i want to say that america has always been a nation of pioneers and patriots, risk-takers and free thinkers, and dedicated workers who have honed a trade, mastered their field, and teach their children to always give their very, very best. every day indian-americans help write the story of american greatness, and everyone here today has a crucial part to play in building an even grander and greater american and indian future.    to help achieve that exciting vision, we are strengthening our cherished bonds with the nation of india, and we are proving the awesome power of democracy and unlimited potential of free people. together, we will continue to deepen the ties between our nations. we will honor the faith of dignity of our citizens, and we will achieve incredible advancements for our people, for our children, and for the world. we will discover new cures and save millions of lives. we will advance cutting-edge technologies and lift millions and millions of people out of poverty. we will pioneer new frontiers in space, working together, raising the sights of humanity. we will uphold our values, defend our liberty, and control our destiny. the united states and india will make our nations stronger, our people wealthier, our dreamers bigger, and our future brighter than ever before, and it wont even be close.    i want to thank everybody for being here. i want to especially thank a great man and a great leader, the leader of india, prime minister modi, my friend. thank you. god bless you all. god bless india, and god bless america. thank you. thank you. now i would like to invite onto this stage in front of this incredible group of unbelievable people prime minister modi, whos going to give us some of his wisdom. his wisdom is indeed great. thank you all very much. its been a great honor to be with you. thank you. thank you.    well, thank you very much. this is certainly being home for me. i spent a lot of time right here. i was in queens, so id come here and this was like the luxury location for me and i love it. i love the people here. even coming in from the airport, i sat with nikki haley, whos here someplace. wheres our nikki? ambassador nikki haley, who is so incredible. and shes seen crowds in her life. and she said, boy. those are really big crowds. crowds of people all lining the streets all the way over to here and its really a special place. and so when i heard about this, i said, i want to do that one. but i really wanted to do it, not because of location, but because, as you know, i am the big, big believer and admirer of the people in law enforcement. okay? from day one. from day one.    we love our police. we love our sheriffs and we love our ice officers and they have been working hard. thank you. they have been working hard    together were going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities. and were going to destroy the vile criminal cartel, ms-13, and many other gangs... but ms-13 is particularly violent. they dont like shooting people because its too quick. its too fast. i was reading... one of these animals was caught and explaining they liked to knife them and cut them and let them die slowly because that way its more painful and they enjoy watching that much more. these are animals.    were joined today by police and sheriffs from suffolk, nassau, duchess and ulster counties. state police from new york and new jersey. many of you i know. great friends. immigration and customs enforcement officers, and law enforcement personnel from a number of federal agencies, so were loaded up with great people. thats what i call it. and i want to just tell you all together right now, and the reason i came... this is the most important sentence to me. on behalf of the american people, i want to say, thank you. thank you very much.    thank you. and i dont think you know how much the public respects and admires you. youre saving american lives every day and we have your backs. believe me. we have your backs 100%. not like the old days. not like the old days.    you know, when you want to take over used military equipment, they were saying you couldnt do it, you know what i said. that was my first day. you can do it. in fact, that stuff is disappearing so fast we have none left. you guys know how to you... you really knew how to get that, but thats my honor. and ill tell you what, its being put to good use.    i especially want to thank ice director, tom homan, who has done an incredible job in just a short period of time. tom. get up here. i know youre just...    tom is determined to rid our nation of cartels and criminals who are preying on our citizens. and i can only say to tom, keep up the great work. hes a tough guy. hes a tough cookie. somebody said the other day... they saw him on television. somebody that were interviewed after that, they said, he looks very nasty. he looks very mean. i said, thats what im looking for. thats exactly what i was looking for.    and for that, i want to congratulate john kelly, who has done an incredible job of secretary of homeland security. incredible. one of our real stars. truly one of our stars. john kelly is one of our great stars. you know, the borders down 78%. under past administrations, the border didnt go down it went up. but if it went down 1%, it was like, this was a great thing. down 78%. and, in fact, the southern border of mexico? we did them a big favor. believe me. they get very little traffic in there anymore because they know theyre not going to get through the border to the united states. so, that whole group has been incredible. led by general kelly.    let me also express our gratitude to the members of the new york delegation here today. congressman chris collins. wheres chris? wheres chris? oh. chris. right from the beginning, he said, trump is going to win. trump is going to win. thats why i like him. i didnt like him that much before now. i love him. ill never... dan donovan. thanks, dan. thank you, dan. and lee zeldin, who i supported right from the beginning when they said he didnt have a chance of beating a pretty popular incumbent. and i saw him in a debate, i said, i think this guys going to win. but he fought a pretty popular guy. and i said, i think hes going to win. and went heavy for him and he won. and he won pretty easily, didnt you? pretty good. im proud of you. great job.    and, of course, a legend, somebody that we all know very well, sort of my neighbor because i consider him a neighbor, but hes really a great and highly respected man in washington, congressman peter king. very respected guy. he is a respected man that people like to ask opinions of. i do. congressman king and his colleagues know the terrible pain and violence ms-13 has inflicted upon this community and this country. and if you remember, just a little more than two years ago, when i came down the escalator with melania and i made the speech. people coming into this country, everyone said, what does he know? whats he talking about? and there was bedlam. remember bedlam? and then about two months later, they said, you know, hes right. so im honored to have brought it to everybodys attention, but the suffering and the pain that we were going through... and now you can look at the numbers. its a whole different world. and it will get better and better and better because weve been able to start nipping it in the bud. weve nipped it in the bud. lets call it, start nipping it in the.... in the bud.    and ms-13, the cartel, has spread gruesome bloodshed throughout the united states. weve gotten a lot of them out of here. big, big percentage. but the rest of coming. theyll be out of here quickly, right? quickly. good.    so, i asked tom on the plane... he was ever in air force one, i said, how do you like it? he said, i like it. but i said, hey, tom, let me ask you a question. how tough are these guys? ms-13? he said-    tom, let me ask you a question. how tough are these guys, ms-13? he said, theyre nothing compared to my guys. nothing. and thats what you need. sometimes thats what you need. right? for many years, they exploited americas weak borders and lax immigration enforcement to bring drugs and violence to cities and towns all across america. theyre there right now because of weak political leadership, weak leadership, weak policing, and in many cases, because the police werent allowed to do their job. ive met police that are great police that arent allowed to do their job because they have a pathetic mayor, or a mayor doesnt know whats going on. were you applauding for someone in particular? its sad. its sad. you look at whats happening, its sad. but hopefully, certainly in the country, those days are over. you may have a little bit longer to wait. but from now on, were going to enforce our laws, protect our borders and support our police like our police have never been supported before. were going to support you like youve never been supported before.    few communities have suffered worse at the hands of these ms-13 thugs than the people of long island. hard to believe. i grew up on long island. i didnt know about this. i didnt know about this. and then all of a sudden, this is like a new phenomena. our hearts and our nation grieve for the victims and their families. since january 16th, think of this, ms-13 gang members have brutally murdered 17 beautiful young lives in this area on long island alone. think of it. they butchered those little girls. they kidnap, they extort, they rape and they rob. they prey on children. they shouldnt be here. they stomp on their victims, they beat them with clubs, they slash them with machetes, and they stab them with knives. they have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful quiet neighborhoods into blood stained killing fields. theyre animals.    we cannot tolerate as a society the spilling of innocent, young, wonderful, vibrant people, sons and daughters, even husbands and wives. we cannot accept this violence one day more. cant do it. and were not going to do it. because of you, were not going to be able to do it. youre not going to allow it to happen. and were backing you up 100%. remember that, 100%.    it is the policy of this administration to dismantle, decimate, and eradicate ms-13 at every other ... and i have to say, ms- 13, thats a name. rough groups, thats fine. weve got a lot of others. and they were all let in here over a relatively short period of time. not during my period of time, believe me, but were getting them out. theyre going to jails, and then theyre going back to their country. or, theyre going back to their country, period.    one by one, were liberating our american towns. can you believe that im saying that? im talking about liberating our towns. its like id see in a movie. theyre liberating the town, like in the old wild west, right? were liberating our towns. i never thought id be standing up here talking about liberating the towns on long island, where i grew up, but thats what youre doing. and i can tell you, i saw some photos where toms guys, rough guys, theyre rough. i dont want to be, i dont want to, you know, say it because theyll say thats not politically correct. youre not allowed to have rough people doing this kind of work. we have to get ... just like they dont want to have rich people at the head of treasury. okay?    like, i want a rich guy at the head of treasury, right? right? right? i want a rich guy at the head of commerce, because weve been screwed so badly on trade deals, i want people that made a lot of money now to make a lot of money for our country. and by the way, as i was walking up, they just gave me the numbers. our numbers just came out this morning. gdp is up double from what it was in the first quarter. 2.6%. were doing well. were doing really well. and we took off all those restrictions and some were statutorily stuck with for a little while. but eventually that statute comes up and were going to be able to cut a lot more. but weve sort of liberated the world of creating jobs, like youre liberating us and the people that live in areas.    but i have to say, one by one, we are indeed freeing up these great american towns and cities that are under siege from gang violence. look at los angeles. look at whats going on in los angeles. look at chicago. what is going on? is anybody here from chicago? we have to send some of you to chicago, i think. whats going on? i mean, you see whats happening there? do we agree? is there something maybe ... is there something ...    i have to tell you one chicago story. so, chicago is having this unbelievable violence. people being killed. four, five, six in a weekend, and im saying what is going on? when i was running, we had motorcycle brigades take us to the planes and stuff. and one of the guys, really good, you could see a really respected officer, police officer. he was at the head. he was the boss. and you could see he was the boss. he actually talked like the boss, come on, get lined up, because id always take pictures with the police, because i did that. my guys said dont do it. dont do it. other candidates didnt do it, that i was beating by 40 points. can you believe it? but i did it. maybe thats why i was winning by 40 points, but other candidates wouldnt do it. but i always took the pictures with the police.    but were in chicago and we had massive motorcycle brigades. and you know, those people have to volunteer. i dont know if you know that, but from what i understand they have to volunteer. and i had the biggest brigades. i had brigades sometimes with almost 300 motorcycles. even i was impressed. id look ahead and it was nothing but motorcycles, because theyd volunteer from all of the various states. but this one guy was impressive. he was a rough cookie and really respected guy. i could see he was respected. and hes like, all right, come on, get over here, get over here. hes got to get to work. get over here. and i said, so let me tell you, youre from chicago? yes, sir. i said, what the hell is going on? and he said, its a problem can be straightened out. i said, ow long would it take you to straighten out this problem? he said, if he gave me the authority, couple of days. i really mean it. i said, you really think so? he said, a couple of days. we know all the bad ones.    i said, you really think so? he said a couple of days. we know all the bad ones, we know them all. and he said, the office is you guys, you know all the bad ones in your area, you know them by their names. i said, we know them all. a couple of days. i said, youve got to be kidding. now this is a year and a half ago. i said, give me your card. and he gave me a card and i sent it to the mayor. i said, you ought to try using this guy. guess what happened? never heard. and last week they had another record. its horrible, but were just getting started. we will restore law and order on long island. well bring back justice to the united states. im very happy to have gotten a great justice of the united states supreme court, not only nominated but approved. and by the way, your second amendment is safe.    your second amendment is safe. i feel very good about that. wasnt looking so good for the second amendment. was it? huh? if trump doesnt win, your second amendment is gone. your second amendment would be gone. but i have a simple message today for every gang member and criminal alien that are threatening, so violently, our people. we will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you and we will deport you. and we had some problems with certain countries, still do with a couple, but well take care of them. dont worry about it. anytime we have a trade deficit, its very easy, which is almost everywhere. we have trade deficits with almost every country, because we had a lot of really bad negotiators making deals with other countries. so its almost everywhere. so that takes care of itself. but we had certain countries in south america where they wouldnt take the people back.    i said, thats okay, no more trade. all of a sudden they started taking their people back. its amazing. isnt it? they used to send to the former secretary of state of the country, please call, would you please work it so that we could take? and they used to just tell her, no, we wont take back. they take back with us every single time. were having very little problem. are we having any problem right now with that? huh? you better believe it. give me the names of the few problems. well take care of it, im telling you. its unbelievable. one of the people that represented the other administration, i said, why didnt you use that? the power of economic? sir, we think one thing has nothing to do with another. i said, oh, really? so well have big deficits and they wont take back these criminals that came from there and should be back there?    well, believe me to me, everything matters, but theyre all taking them back. i saw offices recently conducted the largest crackdown on criminal gangs in the history of our country. in just six weeks, ice and our law enforcement partners arrested nearly 1,400 suspects and sees more than 200 illegal firearms and some beauties and nearly 600 pounds of narcotics. the men and women of ice are turning the tide in the battle against ms-13, but we need more resources from congress and were getting them. congress is actually opening up and really doing a job. they should have approved healthcare last night, but you cant have everything. boy, oh, boy. theyve been working on that one for seven years. can you believe that? the swamp, but well get it done. were going to get it done. i said from the beginning, let obamacare implode and then do it. i turned out to be right. let obamacare implode.    right now we have less than 6,000 enforcement and removal officers in ice. this is not enough to protect a nation of more than 320 million people. its essential that congress fund another 10,000 ice officers, and were asking for that, so that we can eliminate ms-13 and root out the criminal cartels from our country. now were getting them out anyway, but we would like to get them out a lot faster. and when you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a patty wagon, you just see them thrown in rough. i said, please, dont be too nice. like when you guys put somebody in the car and youre protecting their head, the way you put their hand over... like dont hit their head and theyve just killed somebody. dont hit their head. i said, you can take the hand away. okay? its essential that congress fund hundreds more federal immigration judges and prosecutors. and we need them quickly.    if were going to dismantle these deadly networks and i have to tell you, the laws are so horrendously stacked against us because for years and years, theyve been made to protect the criminal. totally made to protect the criminal, not the offices. you do something wrong, youre in more jeopardy than they are. these laws are stacked against you. were changing those laws. but in the meantime, we need judges for the simplest thing, things that you should be able to do without a judge, but we have to have those judges quickly. in the meantime, were trying to change the laws. were also working with chairman bob goodlatte on a series of enforcement measures, and hes a terrific guy, to keep our country safe from crime and terrorism. and in particular, radical islamic terrorism. a term never uttered by past administration, never uttered. did anybody ever hear that term? i dont think so.    but you heard it from me. that includes cracking down on sanctuary cities that defy federal law, shield visa overstays, and that release dangerous criminals back into the united states communities. thats whats happening. theyre releasing them so many deaths where they release somebody back into the community, and they know its going to end that way. thats the sad... they know its going to end that way. were ending those procedures. we have to secure... thank you. i spoke to parents, incredible parents. i got to know so many parents of children that were so horribly killed, burned to death, beaten to death, just the worst kind of death you can ever... stuffed in barrels. and the person that did it was released. and you would look at the file, and they were letter after letter, after letter of people begging not to let this animal back into society, that this would happen.    it would happen quickly. it wasnt even like it would happen over a long period of time. they were saying it would happen quickly. its total violence. hes a totally violent person. you cannot let this person out. they let the person out. and sometimes it would happen on the first day. and then you have to talk to the parents and hold the parents and hug them and theyre crying. i mean, crying, their lives are destroyed. and nobody thinks about those people. they dont think about those people. theyre devastated, but were ending so much of that. were ending hopefully all of that. the laws are tough. the laws are stacked against us, but were ending them.    so were going to secure our border against illegal entry, and we will build the wall. that i can tell you. in fact last night, you dont read about this too much, but it was approved, 1.6 billion for the phase one of the wall, which is not only design but the start of construction over a period of about two years, but the start of construction for a great border wall. and were going to build it. the wall is vital, and vital as a tool for ending the humanitarian disaster, really brought on by drug smugglers, and new words that we havent heard too much of human traffickers. this is a term thats been going on from the beginning of time, and they say its worse now than it ever was. you go back a thousand years, when you think of human trafficking, you go back 500 years, 200 years, 100 years, human trafficking they say, think of it, what they do. human trafficking is worse now maybe than its ever been in the history of this world.    we need a wall. we also need it though for the drugs, because the drugs arent going through walls very easily, especially the walls that i build. im a very good builder. you people know that better than most because you live in the area. thats why im here. well build a good wall. were going to build a real wall. were going to build a wall that works, and its going to have a huge impact on the inflow of drugs coming across. the wall is almost ... that could be one of the main reasons you have to have it. its an additional tool to stop the inflow of drugs into our country.    the previous administration enacted an open door policy to illegal immigrants from central america. welcome in, come in please, please. as a result, ms-13 surge into the country and scoured and just absolutely destroyed so much in front of it. new arrivals came in and they were all made recruits of each other, and they fought with each other and then they fought outside of each other and it got worse and worse. weve turned that back. in the three years before i took office, more than 150,000 unaccompanied alien minors arrived at the border and were released all throughout our country into united states communities, at a tremendous monetary cost to local taxpayers, and also a great cost to life and safety. nearly 4,000 from this wave were released into suffolk county. congratulations. including seven who are now indicted for murder. you know about that. in washington dc region, at least 42 alien minors from the border surge have been recently implicated in ms-13 related violence, including 19 charged in killings or attempted killings. you say, what happened to the old days where people came into this country, they worked and they worked and they worked and they had families and they paid taxes and they did all sorts of things and their families got stronger and they were closely knit. we dont see that. failure to enforce our immigration laws had predictable results: drugs, gangs, and violence. but thats all changing now. under the trump administration, america is once more a nation of laws and once again a nation that stands up for our law enforcement officers. we will defend our country, protect our communities and put the safety of the american people first. and im doing that with law enforcement and were doing that with trade and were doing that with so much else. its called america first. its called that expression im sure youve never heard of, make america great again. has anybody heard that expression? have you heard that? that is my promise to each of you. that is the oath i took as president. and that is my sacred pledge to the american people. thank you everyone here today. you are really special, special americans. and thank you in particular to the great police sheriffs and ice officers. you do a spectacular job. the country loves you. the country respects you. you dont hear it, but believe me, they respect you as much as they respect anything. there is the respect about our country. you are spectacular people.    because of the danger of your job, which people also understand fully, i leave you with the following. thank you and may god bless you. may god bless the united states of america. thank you very much. thank you. thank you very much.    its essential that congress fund another 10,000 ice officers, and were asking for that, so that we can eliminate ms-13 and root out the criminal cartels from our country. now, were getting them out anyway, but wed like to get them out a lot faster. and when you see these towns, and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in rough. i said, please dont be too nice. like when you guys put somebody in the car and youre protecting their head, you know, the way you put the hand over, like dont hit their head. and theyve just killed somebody. dont hit their head. i said, you can take the hand away, okay?   i worked so hard for this state. i worked so hard. you just got two of the greatest trade deals, and add japan to it, by the way. lets make it three, 40 billion from japan, usmca, all done. china, all done for the farmers. its done, that i can tell you. youre going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land. youve got to produce a lot of product. i dont know if you can, but, hello des moines. its great to be with you. im thrilled to be back in american heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking american patriots. great people. this november were going to defeat the radical socialist democrats that are right down the street.    i mean, i dont even know. i just saw, new york times, can you believe? failing new york times... when we leave in 10, 14, 18, 22 years from now, the new york times will be out of business and so will a lot of others. but, did you see they did a new york times poll, i think, and sienna, sienna, new york times of iowa, and they have me pitted against every one of the socialists, and were winning by a lot. everyone. were beating them all. were beating them all. were beating them all. were beating them like they havent been beaten before. you know all the noises about their crazy debates, nobodys watching their debates, but its all about their debates. they dont care about the farmer. everything out here, they love trump, and you should love trump with what ive done.    so, were going to win the great state of iowa and its going to be a historic landslide. if we dont win, your farms are going to hell. i can tell you right now. sell, sell, theyll be saying sell. no, we love the farmers, and we love the ranchers, and we love the manufacturers, frankly. you got plenty of that too in this state. the great state, and you have a great governor, by the way. you have a great governor.    but every day were achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the hawkeye state. the iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history. thats not bad. thats not bad. oh, lets vote for pocahontas. lets vote for bernie. lets vote for sleepy joe. hes falling asleep. joe, joe, joe. he always gets the name wrong. how many times has he missed it? hes in iowa. he says, great to be in the great state of ohio. they say, joe, youre in iowa. you cant do that. no matter how great you speak. if youre winston churchill, if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech, its over. you might as well just wrap it up. theres the fake news. they would just absolutely destroy you. they would absolutely destroy you.    you cant do that. you cant do that, joe, sleepy joe, but you have these guys. you have these people. how about buttigieg? buttigieg. they call him mayor pete. you know why? because nobody can pronounce his name. nobody has any idea. buttigieg. they say, say edge edge. he presides over a city thats failed. its doing so badly, in a state thats having the greatest year theyve ever had, and they have a great governor also, and they had a great governor. you just heard from him, right? the great state of indiana, so i dont see that one. go down the line. we have some people. lets not talk about them. what happened to mini mike? where is he? hes not running. hes skipping four or five states. mini mike. ive had him up to here.    more people are working right now in iowa than ever before. now think of it. think of it. yesterday we replaced a nafta disaster with the incredible brand new u.s. mexico canada agreement. the usmca, you know when you have a hard time with that one, memory is a great thing. ive always had a great memory for whatever reason, but memory is a great thing. having a great memory, but sometimes you take little clues. usmca. thank you, darling. i love you, too. where is that person up? look at that. wow. what a good, strong voice.    but you know how you remember it? the song i just walked in on. theyre playing the song ymca. so, when youre having a hard time, gee, whats u-s, just think of the song ymca, and youll remember it, usmca. its a massive win for iowa farmers and workers of all kinds. its a massive win and it creates some fairness with canada. it creates fairness with mexico. probably the biggest reason that i ran was the unfair trade that ive seen, and one after one, china, mexico, canada, japan, south korea, weve made all these deals, and we have plenty left over. plenty left over. europe, europe, europe is next. i wanted to finish china before we started on europe. i like to do them one at a time, one at a time. im a very organized person.    but weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with china that will boost american agriculture by $50 billion every year, and many other businesses like manufacturing, banking, finance, overall $250 billion, and you know with the farmers, because i have a place in my heart for the farmers big. i went and i saw ambassador lighthizers in charge, hes fantastic. i said, what are you doing? were getting ready for the final deal. what are you doing? he said, im putting in $20 billion. because i asked sonny perdue. hes great. you know who he is, right? secretary of agriculture. i said, sonny, whats the biggest number that chinas ever done with the farmers? he said, sir, $16 billion last year. $16 billion. this was two years ago. i said, so, $16 billion is the biggest, because you know, they targeted you, and now were friends with china.    in fact, maybe weve never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the coronavirus. were working with them very, very closely. we only have five people. hopefully everythings going to be great. they have somewhat of a problem, but hopefully its all going to be great. but, were working with china just so you know, and other countries very, very closely, so it doesnt get out of hand, but its something that we have to be very, very careful with, right? we have to be very careful.    but i said to sonny perdue, secretary of agriculture, i said, sonny, whats the number? 16 and 12 the year before, and you were targeted. i dont blame china. look, theyre smart. theyre negotiators. they targeted trump states. where do they love trump? they love him in iowa. they love him in nebraska. they love him in all these states. they love him in wisconsin. they love him. we won wisconsin. they like him and wisconsin, and a lot of the farm states, and they targeted. the farmers came to see me and they said, sir, you have to do whats right. when the fake news would interview farmers, the farmers would say, no, no, president trump is doing the right thing. it should have been done years ago. shouldve been done years and years ago. but you couldnt have made it because there was too much money, $16 billion. so, what i did is i put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from china, $250 billion, and then more tariffs on things beyond the $250 billion market. we took in billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. we still are, and then what happened? when i heard about the farmers and i saw the farmers, they were in the white house. they came to see me. i had 36 farmers and i said, im going to give you. they said, sir, we dont want anything. i said, what do you mean you dont want anything? ive never heard that before. everybody wants money. they want every. they said, we just want a level playing field. i never forgot it. they said, we dont want anything. we just want a level playing field, and weve been treated badly for years, for years.    i said, well, you havent been given a level playing field for many, many years, for decades. you havent been given a level playing field. were going to give you the levelest field that you ever had. but, but in the meantime, im going to give you $12 billion, out of these tens of billions that were collecting. dont worry. we had plenty of left over, because we never got 25 cents from china. china took from us. we didnt take from china, right? i said, im going to give you $12 billion for the year before, and im going to give you $16 billion for this year. that was last year for this year. so, they got, meaning you, a lot of you in this audience, got $12 billion, and you got 16, so you got $28 billion over that short period of time, and you were able to actually, in some cases, i guess thrive. i told sonny, i want to take care of the small farmer too, not just the big monsters. i want to take care of everyone, everyone.    but, i never forgot when cnn fake news and all these people, they go around interviewing the farmers. they could never find anyone saying bad about trump. theyd go into diners. what do you think about trump? isnt it a terrible what hes doing with the trade? the farmer would say, no, hes doing what should have been done 20 years ago. now, you people are going to make so much money. youre not going to do just, you know what? just relax. take it easy. put it away. enjoy your life. but youre going to make a lot of money. youre going to make a lot of money. again, we have never had, because they respect us now, they didnt respect us. we have never had a better relationship with china than we do right now. its a beautiful story. they respect us. the whole world respects us now. were respected again. america is respected again. okay?    were fighting for products made in america and grown right here in this great, great state of iowa. to keep america safe, we have fully rebuilt the united states military. its now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before. we have all brand new equipment and it was all built in the usa. thanks to the courage of american heroes, the isis caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader, the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead.    crazy nancy pelosi said, dont call him an animal. hes a human being. no, hes an animal. hes an animal. two weeks ago, at my direction, the united states military delivered another historic win for american justice. our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the worlds number one terrorist, qasem soleimani. qasem soleimani. he was the mastermind of the road side bomb. he loved roadside bombs. when you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries, frankly, walking around, they dont have legs, they dont have arms in some cases. some cases they dont have both. you see them walking around, or riding around, or the most brave people, these people have the greatest attitude. i go to walter reed and i see him and the young man his legs were blown off. how you doing? sir, i want to get back. i want to get back, sir. ill tell you, the spirit of these people, it may even top the farmers. it may even top the farmers, which is pretty good.    but he was responsible, more than anybody else, 90% they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us, he was responsible and he took a hard hit. he took a very hard hit. he was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of americans, and hundreds of thousands of other people. not acceptable. soleimani was actively planning new attacks, but we ended his bloody rampage forever.    yet, washington democrats, true, like crazy bernie and nancy pelosi, opposed our decision to eliminate soleimani, and to save american lives. that had a tremendous impact. while were proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists, congressional democrats are consumed with partisan rage, and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax. you know, were having probably the best years that weve ever had in the history of our country, and i just got impeached. can you believe these people? i got impeached. they impeached trump. the best trade deals, the strongest military, i took care of the vets. we got choice. we got accountability for the vets, accountability. we got all these things and they impeach your president. no, thats not going to work. watch, just watch.    they want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow the entire system of government. thats not happening, i can tell you that. washington democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election. why am i not worried? i should worried. remember nixon, it was like a dark period, right? its a very dark period. it was like oh, you think about it. right? with clinton it was not good. they say that with johnson, it was a long time ago, none of us remember, but they say it was a very dark period. this is a happy period for us. its a happy period. its a happy period because we call this impeachment light. this is light.    crazy schiff. shifty schiff. hes a sick puppy. hes a sick puppy. but, you know what? today you saw it, i hit my highest poll numbers since i got elected because the american people, and frankly, people all over the world, know its a hoax. they understand it. they know its a hoax, and we have a great party, the republican party. they know whats going on. they know whats going on and theyre going to treat us very fairly. but, the democrats are trying to overturn the last election. we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in 2020.    november 3, november 3, mark it off. november 3, mark it off. was that a great day? 2016 november. remember? hes not going to do well with this group. i did well. hes not going to do well with that group. i won that group. hes not going to do well here or there. even the exit polls, they took it right up. you know what they didnt know about the exit polls? when people are leaving, theyre always very accurate. people leave. who you voted for? i voted for trump. who you voted for? i voted for crooked hillary. i dont care that shes a stone cold crook. im voting for her. who are you voting for? im voting for trump, or clinton, or trump. theyre always very accurate, but this time something happened.    many people, many... i like that idea. i like it. i like it. wouldnt we like to run against her. whos tougher? her, crazy bernie, biden, buttigieg? who would be the closest? buttigieg. i dont know. maybe we take another crack at crazy hillary. would that be okay? she was so easy. remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables. remember? remember deplorables? but you know the only thing i didnt understand, i said, thats terrible. but she said another word that was worse. irredeemables. i said, boy, shows you how good i am at politics, i said, shes in trouble. she said our people are irredeemable. to me that was worse. well, it wasnt that word that caught on. it was deplorable. the next day im speaking, and women are walking around, im deplorable. everyones got deplorable. i say, i think she made a bad speech last night. but irredeemable, remember? she called them deplorable and irredeemable, and me being so brilliant, i said, i think that irredeemables going to get her. no, deplorable got her. a lot her like lack of ability.    together we are going to win back the house. we are going to hold the senate, and we are going to keep that beautiful, gorgeous, incredible white house. people dont realize this is a lot of work. i just left michigan, and michigan is booming now because of me, meaning, my people. i say to prime minister abe, hes a friend of mine, shinzo, japan, you got to do something. you got these massive deficits for our country. you got to open up plants in michigan fast, shinzo. fast. youve got to do it. yes, i will do it. hell do it, and hes doing it. countries are coming in from all over the world. theyre going to michigan. theyre coming to iowa. theyre buying your stuff again, like crazy, like crazy.    theyre going to ohio. theyre going to pennsylvania. theyre going to south carolina. theyre going to north carolina. theyre going to florida. theyre coming in like never before. theyre all coming back. i ran on the issue trade. i ran on a lot of different issues, but trade was one of them. that was so big. to me, it was so big. i used to say, how do we allow these companies to close, fire everybody, go to another country? mexico, wherever it may be, make product, sell the product into our country, pay no tax. who the hell would allow this to happen? who would allow to happen?    its like in south korea. i went to him, i said, listen, your deal is no good. we have to make a new deal. south korea, were protecting them all, all these different things. i said, number one, youve got to pay us more. they agreed to. they gave us $500 million a year more. they said, but nobody has ever asked. they gave us 500. thats nothing compared to what they have to do. thats okay. thats okay. theyll pay more. but you know, they made a trade deal with the united states. hillary clinton was in charge of the deal, right? she said its going to produce 250,000 jobs, and she was right. 250,000. you know who it was for? for south korea, not for us, it was for south korea. so, we renegotiated the deal, if i have your permission, we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with south korea, okay?    this deal is going to produce, remember... this deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for south korea. she didnt lie. cant say she lied. she lies about a lot of other things, but she didnt lie. how is she taking her defeat? okay? i think so. remember the debate? do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and i sort of, i didnt exactly say yes. i didnt say yes, in all fairness, but i got sort of like six the 68% there. but she said, see he wont. shes the one that doesnt do it. no, no, i feel badly because its too late for her to get in. i kept hoping, but i think, honestly i think that sleepy joe, crazy bernie, i dont even want to put buttigieg in, but i think theyd actually be tougher than her.    during this campaign season, the good people of iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left. this is a radical left people that were dealing with. todays democrat party, i dont say democratic party, it sounds so much better in a speech, right? democratic party, the democrat, but thats not their name. its called the democrat party. you know some people arent allowed to say the democrat party because it doesnt sound good. i dont even like it. i dont like the way it sounds in this speech, but im going to say it because im not looking to have them look good.    todays democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid medicare, shut down american energy, destroy your social security, they will destroy your social security, eliminate religious liberty, punish free speech, confiscate your guns, abolish your borders, and indoctrinate americas children with hateful, left-wing ideology. other than that, theyre okay. other than that, theyre fine people. in short, this election is a choice between american freedom and democratic socialism, and in some cases, in my opinion, its worse than socialism. socialisms a kind word by comparison. the democrats will lose because america will never be a socialist country. we cant. theyre all watching tonight. theyre sitting in their hotel room, little hotels right down the street, and theyre looking at this crowd. the press never talks about my crowds. did you see in new jersey a couple of nights ago? we had signups for 175,000 people. we had an arena that held about 9,000 people. we could have sold it out 15 times. okay? they dont talk about that. you know what they talk about? they said donald trump who spoke before a nice crowd. if bernie or sleepy joe has, i mean joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table. no, its true. no, they were in a gymnasium. there were in a gymnasium, and they set up a round table, and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked, what do you think of socialism? they just said, i just want to be here to watch his speech. they set up a round-    they just said, i just want to be here to watch a speech. they set up a round table because the crowd was so small, and then theyll say, it was a brilliant round table. it was wonderful. they never mention crowds. they never mention crowds. they never mention anything. ill tell you, u.s.m.c.a, the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. okay? it is, wait. it barely got any mention. we signed it. it barely got any mention. they talk about the impeachment hoax. they talk about all the other stuff, but the trade deal, that is going to change our country. its going to bring growth. wait until you see, toward the end of next year, the growth will be astronomical because of the china trade deal, the u.s.m.c.a, japan, south korea, europe, when that happens. it will happen because they have no choice. they have no choice.    but in the papers, and on the fake news cable shows, and the regular, look, nbc is horrible, the nbc nightly news, its terrible. the good news is people dont watch it like they used to, because they dont believe in it. they dont believe in it. and as sean hannity would say, msdnc, you know what msdnc is, right, so bad. cnn, total fake stuff. oops, their camera just went off. look! the camera just went off! cnn!    their camera just went off. that always happens whenever i say cnn, their camera goes off.    but americans, across the political spectrum, were disgusted by the washington democrats, the partisan hoaxes, the witch hunts, the con jobs. its all a con job. and so, they dont love our country, i swear they dont. you look at nancy pelosis district in san francisco. it was so beautiful, and now its a disgrace, being watched all over the world. needles all over the place, everything else all over the place. im not going to get into it, washing down into the ocean, washing down onto their beaches, people living in tents if theyre lucky. i mean you never saw anything, living on their most important entryways into what was a great city, san francisco. whats happened? and all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff.    really, these people are very, very bad for our country. we have to take back the house of representatives, we have to.    registered democrats and independents are leaving the democrat party in droves, and we are welcoming these people, and these great voters, to the republican party with wide, open arms.    and we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders, a lot of your really wonderful people. im not going to mention all the names, because all those cameras that are rolling, they dont like it when i do it, but one they dont mind is governor kim reynolds. come up, kim, come up here! also first gentleman, kevin reynolds, kevin!    kim, come on, come on.    you want to say something?    great, great job. thank you.    oh, she was driving me a little bit batty. she would call me up, kim, you would call. what about ethanol? i said kim, i mean, im doing a lot for that place.    no, no. we want ethanol. then, we want biofuel. then she is asking for things i never even heard of, but we got them all, whatever that hell she wanted, we got. right? and by the way, joni ernst and the great chuck grassley are right now in washington fighting for fairness, fighting the hoax, fighting for all of us. they called, they said, do you mind if we dont go tonight? we have to stay. i said, i dont want you to be there. i want you to be where you are because they are fighting for us. they are great people. they are great people.    and, they would call too. chuck grassley, joni ernst, they would call, we got to help our farmers, sir.    yes. okay, we are going to help the farmer. they were great. lieutenant governor adam gregg. thank you, adam. thank you, adam. great job, adam. speaker of the iowa house of representatives, a man with really fantastic genes, got to have like the best genes in the world. although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes, too. we have his son in the audience, too, but this is representatives pat grassley. those genes, those two young men have the greatest genes anyone has ever had for politics. thank you, fellas, thanks. i sent one of them, the father to china, and hes now ambassador to china. do you think he is happy? is he happy? i think so. i think he is happy. great governor, longest serving governor in history, actually, 24 years. we have the chairman of the republican party of iowa, jeff kaufmann. great job.    and just quickly, we have the worlds tallest campaign manager, brad parscale. and republican national committee co-chair, who has done an incredible job, tommy hicks. and we have the great negotiator, the great man, bob lighthizer with us here, someplace. wheres bob? what a job he did negotiating for you.    and we have somebody that you never heard of, somebody thats a fantastic person, but you never heard of, somebody named sarah sanders. have you ever heard of her? come here, sarah! come on! thats pretty good! and we have a great football player, from iowa, matt whitaker is here, matt. say something.    thank you, sarah. very popular. she is a terrific person, great person. thanks to republican leadership, american now has the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth, not even close. every prime minister, president, king, queen, dictator, whatever you want to call them, they all say, how did you do it? and, the truth is we have certain advantages, but we also have a people advantage. we have the greatest people in the world. i really mean that.    since the election, we have created seven million new jobs. the average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. can you believe that? the lowest unemployment rate. african american, hispanic american, and asian american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded, think of that.    more than two million millennials, you know what millennials are, young, great people with a lot of future, they have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5% annually. thats a record.    another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34, people are now working, and thats a record, the number of people, 25 to 34.    and under the so-called trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group. and thats a great thing. this is a blue collar boom, and thats a good thing too. thats a good thing.    earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% for the first time ever, for the first time ever.    and median household income is at an all time high, just for one second, president bush, eight years, $450. president barack hussein obama, eight years, eight years, $975. president donald john trump, two and a half years, not three, because the numbers were taken at two and a half, now its actually higher. two and a half years, including the tax cuts which are massive, and including all of the regulatory cuts, and the other things you have gotten, $10,000. think of it.    you have eight years, 450. eight years, 975. two and a half years, think of it, $10,000. its one of the reasons the economy is doing so well. and let the people down the road tell you about that, okay? let them tell you about that. and those tractors that i told you to buy, your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it. they will be 60 years old. they will be old, tired, exhausted. your land will be exhausted. you will be exhausted.    weve ended the war on american energy. the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far. we are also proudly promoting american ethanol, and i recently approved e15 to be used all year round! biofuel also, but the socialist democrats want to shut down american energy. they support representative ocasio-cortez.    its a real beauty. thats a real beauty. thats a beauty. i cant even believe it, but i dont want to knock it, because the green new deal, which would crush our farms, destroy our wonderful cows. i love cows. they want to kill our cows. you know why, right? you know why?    dont say it. they want to kill our cows. that means you are next. and they want to wipe out, totally, iowa ethanol. they want to wipe it out. but we will never let that side get in, and by the way, thats the least of it. but i dont want to attack the green new deal, because they might change it.    i said to her the other day, they said, what do you think of the green new deal? i said, well, it should be studied carefully. we should look at it, look at it closely. i dont want to talk about until about two months before the election. and then i will tell you how totally insane it is.    how about this crazy senator? how about this crazy, crazy senator from hawaii? they said, im totally in favor, not the smartest. she said, im totally in favor of the green new deal. well, that would mean theres no more airplanes. oh! they started screaming at her in hawaii, they said, how the hell are we going to get to hawaii? they said, were going to build a railroad. she said that would be the worlds longest track. its the worlds longest. she doesnt know that they dont want airplanes anymore, and yet they fly around in brand new gulfstreams, in brand new planes all over the place. theyre flying from place to place. theyre talking about the carbon footprint. were going to destroy the carbon footprint! what time is my plane taking off, please?    to lift up forgotten communities, the republican tax cut launched opportunity zones, jobs, and investment, and now rushing into over 60 newly... and this is incredible, brand, newly designated opportunity zones right here in iowa alone. rich people are investing vast amounts of money. tim scott, senator tim scott, south carolina, came into my office. he said, i have an idea that i have wanted to do for years, but we have never had a president that could pull it off. i said, what is it, tim? and he talked about opportunity zones, first time i heard it. and we did it, and there is nothing, nobody has ever seen anything like it. money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there. whats happening is incredible. opportunity zones. remember it.    for decades, politicians ran for office, promising to protect american farmers and workers. youve heard it all your lives, right? but then, they went to washington. they looked at those beautiful marble columns, and that gorgeous ceiling painted, and all that gold, the way they used to build the buildings, they dont build them that way anymore. we could, but they just dont know how. by the way, were building the wall. you know the wall is over a hundred miles long. its over a hundred miles long already and moving fast.    they went to washington and they sold you out. thats what happened. they sold your jobs out. they sold everything out. globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories, ravage our farms, rob our workers, and ransack our communities. but the era of economic surrender is over, because now we are finally putting america first, america first.    before i took office, washington looked the other way, while china stole our secrets from american agriculture. your business, what they do scientifically, nobody understands what they have done to a seed. it doesnt sound complicated. it is genius, what they have been able to do, what you have been able to do. but those secrets were being stolen, stolen. and installed massive barriers to your exports. you couldnt do anything with exports, so people, not only china, many, many other places were stealing your secrets.    our new agreement with china will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for american beef, pork, poultry, seafood, soybeans, rice, dairy, and much, much more.    but you know it is true. china is so big. 1.5 billion people. we have 350. 1.5 billion people, think of that, and we are just touching it. this deal will be so big. if it all works out, and you have the best product, the best product in the world, if it all works out, it will just keep expanding. 250 billion will end up being much, much more than that.    and, ive told this story before, when we were signing, we were almost finished and i said, how much are the farmers getting? meaning how much are they going to purchase from the farmers. and ambassador lighthizer said, we put 20 billion, sir. the highest ever was 16, so we made it 20. i said make it 50. they said, what? and then people, even farm people, said, sir, we cant produce that much. i said, thats a good problem, not a bad problem. i said, make it 50, so we now have, in the contract, from 40 to $50 billion worth of purchase. make it 50, make it 50! right, jared? i said, jared, you better make it 50.    i want those farmers to come back, say, sir, sir, we cant do it. we cant produce that much, sir, what are you doing to us? i dont think that would ever happen? do you think that would ever, i said they will figure a way. hes going absolutely not. nah, i said, dont make it 20, make it 50.    the u.s.m.c.a. is another colossal victory for american agriculture like you have never had before. its time. we suffered for a year and a half, almost two years. think of it, but not really because i was able to give you those, i wont call them subsidies. i made that mistake once with the farmers. i said to this group of farmers that came in, subsidy. i used the word subsidy. that was the worst word, sir, we dont watch subsidy! please dont ever use that word. i said, i wont, i promise.    but we helped. and it will increase total agriculture exports by more than $2 billion annually. think of that, including the huge dairy in iowa, dairy, pork and poultry alone, so two billion just in those small [inaudible 00:47:23]. just in that small, little grouping where you were doing nothing. its called promises made, promises kept. promises met.    the last time i came, i never did this before, i never ran, so they all said, you never ran before. you cant do this if you never ran, so whatever happened, it happened. one by one, they started dropping out, right? and then i was left with one, hillary clinton, and that worked out very nicely. he cannot get to 270, remember? 270, electoral college. he cannot get to 270.    i went to maine. its true, maine, too. its got one point, right, one. i went there a lot, many times. everyone said, well, they kept getting me, maybe if i have a great night, 269, but 269 loses. right? but we got 306 to 223. 306, 223, so they were right, you cannot get to 270, you can get to 306, but not that there is...    in the eight years before my election, net farm income plummeted by 20%, you know that. if you look at a chart, for 15 years actually, not eight, for 15 years, its like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer. soybeans. take a look at it all. it was just a one way street. everybody was ripping off the american farmer. now youre going to see numbers that are going to be great. look at even whats happened recently. its incredible whats going on and i love it, because you deserve it. you suffered a lot, with people that were stupid. they were stupid! under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50% and will now be rising even faster. what are you going to do? you are going to vote for bernie? you are going to vote for bernie?    here i am on the debate stage, well, net income has gone up for the farmers 50%. tell me, how the hell do i lose this debate? how do i lose? and based on the polls, i guess im not going to lose in this state. i dont think i will lose in any other state either. because this is really true all over the country. this is happening all over the country, not just iowa.    on no issue have washington democrats more thoroughly betrayed the american people than on immigration. illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars, drains public services, overcrowds our schools and hospitals, and threatens innocent american lives at a number that you wouldnt even believe. but we have got it closed up, but were getting your people in. you have people that have worked for you for a long time, dont you? i know who the people that you have, and they are hard workers. we have a lot of great people. you have a lot of great people out there. right here in des moines, a twice deported, illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman, her 11-year-old daughter, and her five-year-old son.    in this region of the county alone, last year, ice officers arrested nearly 4,000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes, including robbery, rape, and murder.    yet todays democrat party glorifies illegal immigration. we have no idea, now we do now, but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands. we have no idea who they are. many are fine people and all of that, but some are stone cold rapists, and murderers, and people that their countries dont want, guatemala, honduras, el salvador, and even mexico. right now we have a love affair with mexico because the democrats, the democrats wouldnt give us what we needed and i got mexico, theyre great. they put up 27,000 soldiers on our southern border and the numbers are plummeting, 87% down.    the president of mexico is doing a great job. and we ended catch and release. you think that was easy? catch and release, you know what catch and release is? you catch a criminal, you take the number, and you release him into the, they would never come back. we say, come back please in three years, this is a democrat deal. come back if you dont mind, in three years. we release them into our country. we totally ended it through a very, very slick group of rules. catch and release. may we please have your address and your phone number? here it is!    what have you done?    i got out of jail.    oh, well, welcome to the united states. please, we have a little information. okay, and now were going to release you, and in three and a half years, we schedule a court appearance for you. do you believe, this is the only country in the world. they catch somebody on the border. youre supposed to be perry mason. you take them to court. other countries catch somebody at the border. they say,  sorry, you got to get out. we say, oh, may we have your information? were taking you to court. man.    todays democrat party glorifies illegal immigration, vilifies the heroes of law enforcement, and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely. they want open borders. they want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country. and some of those people, some of those people are stone cold killers. some of those people, in the caravans, right? i came up with that name but they wont give me credit for that. they dont give me credit for anything. they dont give me credit for fake news. wasnt that my term? now they say, i see cnn, they said, fake news has reported, no, no, you are fake news, that fake news is you. you are fake news.    they turned the term around. they are reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news. left wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into american communities. we dont want them. in new york city, the mayors sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a-    ... the mayors sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault. after being set free the same criminal raped, brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman. they wouldnt give him to the ice warriors. their warriors. theyre tough and they love our country. theyre very tough and they love our country. theyre taking ms-13 gang members ... theyre about as tough as you get, theyre taking them out of our country by the thousands. by the thousands. thats a tough job but they love to do it. they love our country.    sanctuary city policies arent just wrong, theyre immoral, and theyre lethal, and they really are something that has to be stopped. they have to be stopped now. whats happening is a disgrace.    thankfully here in iowa your great republican governor, sometimes referred to as governor reynolds, signed a state-wide ban on sanctuary cities. thank you kim. that is why we need to elect more republicans nationwide, to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states. thank you kim reynolds. you know i endorsed her, so i want to take full credit for the job she has done. i endorsed her very early, right? very early i endorsed her. i know talent. shes done a great job.    democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. republicans stand for law, order, and justice. its true. we are finding the illegal game members, drug dealers, predators, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country, ideally. we dont want to put them in prison because you know what? we got to pay for them for the next 50 years, but sometimes we have to. if theyre too dangerous we have no choice.    thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row, and theyre getting lower, and lower. shockingly, as that wall gets longer, the crossings get less. remember the democrats? you dont need a wall. you dont need a wall. you dont need it. seven years they all voted for it, they just didnt have the ability to build it. you know its not easy with land, and this, and that, and property, and rights. they couldnt figure it out but i can figure it out. the problem was we couldnt get the money, but we got all the money we need now. we have everything. we have everything. the last time, this last budget, they didnt really fight us on the wall. you know why? because they learned its a really bad issue for them. its a really bad issue. but i made one mistake with the wall. i should have said, we will never ever build a wall. they would have given me so much money to build a wall. that was my only ... because i used to go, we will build the wall, right? that was a mistake. i should have said, we will never ever build it. under no circumstances, and they would have forced its building and i would have said, okay.    by the way, in all due respect, you know whos going to pay for the wall, right? no, no, they play ... the fake news plays. no, no, through remittance illegal aliens from mexico are going to pay for the call. thats what it is. remittance. 100% because when i say something i mean it. i said i was going to build a wall.    you think its easy when you have a party that controls the house, you got to end that. you got to end that. they said they picked up the house in 18 but i didnt run in 18. you know the big difference when you run, 16 i ran, 18 i didnt run. they did, they picked up some seats. i didnt run, but im running this time and weve got to take back the house. kevin mccarthy will be a great speaker of the house. kevin mccarthy will be a great speaker, watch.    but getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three, getting it built is ... honestly i dont want to brag, nobody else could have done it. nobody else could have done it. its the real deal wall. its the wall that border security wanted. remember i thought i could just build concrete slabs? they didnt want that because you have to be able to see through. i said, oh come on. this is the expensive version. this is the best version. this is steel, and concrete, and rebar in between. its really something.    did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top? they couldnt get over. we had to get the fire department to get them down. they couldnt get over and theyre like mountain climbers. they got used to climbing. they got caught because you know that panel? thats an anti-climb panel. its very hot and very tough. its a very hard panel to climb, the panel on top. sometimes id say, id rather do without that panel, because im a very visual person. they said, sir thats anti-climb panel. i said, oh it is? okay, lets put it on. to hell with it. its true. anti-climb panel.    the wall is the top of the line. thats what they wanted. mostly 30 feet tall. thats very tall. thats maximum. its really doing a big trick. a lot ... wherever we have it ... 100 miles is all of a sudden a lot, but where you have that its incredible. 99.9%, especially when were watching it. were watching the sections.    illegal crossings now are down 75% since last spring. the powerful border wall was starting to set. i mean pretty soon well be setting records in speed. its going up very rapidly. very rapidly. youre seeing it all over and its going to be really something. look, it would be nice if we didnt have to have it. it would be great, but we have to have it. they said, oh we could have drones. oh what are you going to do with drones flying around? when people are going through your border with nowhere ... theyre going to have drones flying around. they know because they were all for it. they were all for it. now all of a sudden theyre against, but they want drones. well were going to have drones too but the drones are policing the wall.    in terms of human trafficking, people dont even talk about it. because of the internet, sadly, the worst in the history of our world. all over the world. trafficking in women and children all over the world. all over the world. the worst its ever been, but when we have this border it makes it very, very tough for them to come into the united states with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car.    the washington democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional democrats have signed up for bernie sanders government healthcare takeover bill. its a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180,000 million great americans of your private coverage. you want that. you got great deals. youre able to negotiate, youre able to keep your doctor, keep your area, keep your hospitals, keep everything that you wanted. now they want to take it away. report to an operating room when you have a cold, okay? in your local hospital. i dont think so. 180,000 million people, but im not going to knock it because i want bernie to bring it right up to the end and well debate it the day before the election. okay? we are saving your healthcare while socialist democrats are trying to take away your healthcare.    sleepy joe has no idea what hes even ... he doesnt even know what hes talking about. hes so lost. honestly, that poor guys is so lost. they talk healthcare, she said, its over for him. it was over for him, actually if you knew him, a long time ago. now its really over.    we are making healthcare better and cheaper. we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed obamacare. we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the republican party. were stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent. i signed it already. everything now is going to transparencies, where hospitals, doctors, everybody has to tell you how much things are costing. watch those prices come down. right? right?    i have an expert on healthcare. he said transparency because its a big deal. its a big deal. nobody else would have gotten it done, that i can tell you. transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldnt believe. people go in for a blood test, they get charged $2,700. down the road they get the same test for $57. the same exact test. maybe its better. maybe its better. its crazy. when you have transparency its all going to come. you watch. you watch. but this person, a real expert, said, this is bigger than healthcare, and i got it done. unfortunately it wont really start kicking in until after the election because it takes a period of time. they have certain statutory requirements, et cetera.    well you better let me win. can you imagine? can you imagine? i did transparency, i took the guts, i did transparency and then im going to watch as somebody else says, didnt he do a great job for transparency? you better let me win because i want the credit for that one.    were buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever, ever, ever before. we are defending your right to keep the doctor. we are defending your right to keep your plan. remember obama 28 times, you can keep your doctor. you can keep your doctor? 28. you can also keep your plan. you can keep it. you can keep it. 28 times he lied. we should impeach him. no, he got it on a lie. he got it on a lie, but weve run it much better. but essentially its totally different because of individual mandate. because that really took the guts out of it and were running it much better.    i had a choice, do we run it well or do we run it poorly? if we run it poorly everyones going to blame me. if we run it well everyones going to give him credit, especially the fakers back there right? but you know what? we got to run it well but were coming up with a healthcare that if we win the house we will have the best healthcare of any country in the world, by far.    were fighting the lobbyists and were fighting the special interest, in case you didnt notice. we are serving only you. thanks to our bold reforms were now offering health plans that are 60% cheaper than obamacare. were offering a lot of different things. we have just passed, recently, 10 months ago, right to try. i love right to try.    you know what that is? thats people are terminally ill and they cant use medicine because ... theyve been trying to pass this, almost for 50 years. you cant use the medicine. we have the greatest doctors, labs, hospitals in the world. they come up with a medicine but it has to go through the fda procedure, right? you cant do anything. you cant use it. they wont let you use it. now i have you sign an agreement, youre not going to sue the united states, youre not going to this, your family, et cetera, et cetera. very simple. and they can use it. you have no idea the results that are taking place. you have no idea. you have no idea the results. peoples lives are being ...    for me it was simple. i said, wait a minute, youre worried about hurting somebody? these people are dying. theyre terminally ill. theyre admitting theyre terminally ill and you wont let them use a drug that may work? let the use the drug. and were letting them use the drug and its working in a lot of cases.    we have transformed veterans healthcare, including va choice. the best. you know i think im a totally brilliant human being. i think im the smartest person, so i came up with a plan. ill never forget, i was in new hampshire, i came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying, sir its really terrible whats happening with healthcare. were waiting in line for two weeks, for four weeks, for seven weeks. honestly people were waiting in line, they werent very sick, they were terminally ill, truthfully, before they saw a doctor. by the time they got to the doctor. so i came up with this incredible plan. only i could think of this. i said, heres what you do ... heres what you do, if somebody cant get a doctor quickly, because we have great doctors at the va. they dont get enough credit. if you cant get to a doctor quickly you go outside, you go locally, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself all better. right?    so i went back. i went back and i told my people, do you have any idea how smart i am? listen to this plan i have. they said, actually sir weve known about that plan for 52 years we just couldnt get it approved. so i said, oh thats too bad, i thought it was brilliant, but what i am good at is getting things approved and i got it approved. people are using it and its great.    i know the people of iowa dont care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare. we are combating the opioid epidemic. drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. thats a great thing. our great first lady is helping us with that. that is such a big thing for melania. big, big thing. she is really involved.    we will never let the democrats give away your healthcare to illegal immigrants, especially when we say, come in. come in, well give you healthcare. its one thing they come in and its a rough situation because we all have hearts but when people are saying, like in california this wacky governor he says, come in, were going to give you healthcare. were going to give you free education. were going to give you everything. were going to give you a beautiful rolls-royce. see to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said, donald trump said that the governor of california promised a rolls-royce to illegal immigrants. he didnt promise them. this was a lie and a misrepresentation by president trump. they cant take a little humor. they cant take it. these people are sick. theyre sick. no. theyre sick people.    them and shifty schiff is a very sick person. he lies awake at night shifting and turning, shifty. shifting and turning in his bed, sweating like a dog. how am i going to get him? he didnt do anything wrong, how am i going to get him? oh what a sick guy he is.    virtually every top democrat also now supports late-term abortion. ripping babies straight from the mothers womb. right up until the moment of birth. that is why i have asked congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god. democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. no matter how you cut it, thats what it is. the republican party is the party of the american worker, the american family, the american dream, and the late great abraham lincoln. you know that, right? abraham lincoln. honest abe.    remember i always said, i can be more presidential than any other past president, other than perhaps abraham lincoln when hes wearing the hat, right? because its easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me. be a, good evening ladies and gentlemen. is everything okay in iowa? oh i see, the world is ripping you off. well theres not a thing i can do about that. thank you. good night everybody. good night. no, we got to do it the right way. republicans ...    and by the way, can i be honest? doing this takes far more talent than doing that. doing that is very easy. this is not easy. especially when you just left michigan, and you just left other places, and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years. you got the maniacs for three years. i think before i came down the escalator with our future first lady i think really they were doing it then. they started even before i came down on the escalator. these people are maniacs, so you have all that. so youre fighting that and youre doing farm bills.    we got your farm bill approved by the way. we got your farm bill approved. i dont even mention that because thats massive by any other standard, but its peanuts compared to the usmca and the china deal, right? so i dont even mention it.    anyway, republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. its true. our numbers with african american workers, people, are through the roof. are through the roof because ... remember i used to say, what do you have to lose? id read the down the worst on crime, the worst on education. they got this, they got that, they got 10 different things, all horrible. one day im in front of this tremendous group of people and im reading this list, african american, they have the highest crime rate, they have the highest this, they have the worst education, they have the worst schools, they have the worst ... i said, stay with me, because they were with the democrats for a hundred years, more. i said, stay with me. what the hell do you have to lose?    you know what? you know what? remember that? now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers, they have the best poverty numbers, they have numbers that nobody would believe. theyre doing so great. its so great to see it. its incredible. youth unemployment, african american youth. its been great.    were asking all americans to join our incredible movement. we are a big tent and a big party with big, bold, beautiful ideas for the future. were what the country was based on originally. it was called greatness. it was called greatness.    during national school choice week, school choice everybody, we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools. iowa became one of the first states to pass school choice. that was over 10 years ago. now governor reynolds, senator ernst, senator grassley, and more than 100 members of congress are supporting our plan to give school choice to every child in america who needs it. its a great plan.    to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform. think of that. think of that. we had a lot of great conservatives who wanted it, we had liberals who wanted it. they couldnt get it passed. president obama couldnt even come close. he didnt try too hard. he talked like, oh ill try.    to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record, who will interpret the constitution as one. and two great supreme court justices, by the way. as part as ... right? two great ones.    as part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an $8.5 million facility to support our iowa guardsmen at camp dodge, right here in des moines, iowa. right here, camp dodge. camp dodge everybody. we take care of camp dodge.    i recognized israels true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem. we recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights. yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace. were going to see if we can get that done. its one of the toughest deals of all. one of the toughest deals but we have a shot at it.    for years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country. they apologized. they would say, im sorry. now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of iowa. we are standing up for iowa.    at stake in our present battle is the survival, frankly, of our nation. look, i can make this speech really short. all i have to do is say, hello iowa, you have no choice. you have to vote for me. otherwise everything that youve built in your entire life will be gone. goodbye iowa, have a good time. instead i work my ass off up here, okay? yeah. true. do you think this is easy? its a little hot in this room. this room wasnt designed for this many people.    if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in november of 2020. we have to.    by the way, for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children ... because of our great tax bill, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, the biggest that you benefit by. because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax, as they call it. so i always say, if you love your children thats a great thing. if you dont love your children dont leave it to them and that particular tax wont matter, but if you love ... is there anybody here that does not love your children? is there anybody here who loves your children? well its iowa. its iowa. you love your children. you know you have no tax to pay, you leave your ...    in the old days, meaning before trump, what would happen? youd leave your farm, theyd assess your farm for a massive amount that kids would go out to a bank, theyd borrow money up to their eyeballs and theyd end up losing the farm. now you can leave your farm ... and they did that to pay the tax. now you can leave your farm, you dont pay inheritance tax or [inaudible 01:19:03]. no, its great. so when youre looking down at your children youre saying, oh did you get lucky? did you get lucky? look at them, theyre enjoying life.    but only this way can we save the america we love and drain the washington swamp once and for all. that swamp is bad. that swamp is bad. i had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated. its a degenerate swamp. i had no idea. when i came out, i said, were going to drain this swamp. i had no idea that the swamp was that evil, but were winning. were winning because were in the white house. were winning.    with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and poverty to prosperity. thats whats happening all over our country. together we will elect a republican congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. its already happening. we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made, raised, farmed, and grown right here in the usa. we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years. weve already started.    should have been started in the last administration. incredible. should have been started earlier, but we started. in less than 10 years, the aids epidemic will be eradicated, will be gone. who would have thought that was possible? when they came in and told me that a couple of years ago, i said, really? nobody knows that. incredible the strides that weve made.    we will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. in the state of virginia they want to take your guns away, you believe it? virginia, i love virginia. of all states, they want to take your guns away. the democrats. not going to happen.    above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one america. we are one great america. we support, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. we believe that family and faith, not government bureaucracy, are the true american way, not government bureaucracy. we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great american flag. and we live by the words of our national motto, in god we trust. we live by those words, in god we trust.    from cambridge, good old cambridge. whos from cambridge here please? cambridge. what the hell do i mention it for when theres two people here? can i say it anyway? ill say it anyway. good place cambridge. good, he said its amazing. well, from cambridge to council bluffs, from cedar rapids where i made my last speech prior to the election. what a place, 32,000 people. i said, im going to win tomorrow. to rock rapids, from melbourne to moorhead, and from davenport to right here in des moines, iowa. we stand on the shoulders of true red blooded american heroes.    this great state was founded by tough, tough, tough frontier men. these are tough people. lets see how big and how tough. theyre tough. anybody like to join ice? you want to join ice? he says, no thank you. and strong pioneer women who defied the dangers to carve out a life and a beautiful home with great families and great neighbors. they tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, tilled the soil, planted the fields and help make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater and greater every single day.    proud citizens like you helped to build this country and together we are taking back our country. we are returning power to you, the american people, where it has always belonged. its coming back to you, you see that. with your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working and we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. we are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under god. america is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen, and especially the great ladies and gentlemen of iowa, the best is yet to come. true, true. because together we will make america wealthy again. we will make america strong again. we will make america proud again. we will make america safe again and we will make america great again. thank you, iowa. thank you. thank you.   as long as im president of the united states iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. good morning. im pleased to inform you, the american people should be extremely grateful and happy. no americans were harmed in last nights attack by the iranian regime. we suffered no casualties. all of our soldiers are safe,, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. our great american forces are prepared for anything. iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world. no american or iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well.    i salute the incredible skill and courage of americas men and women in uniform. for far too long, all the way back to 1979 to be exact, nations have tolerated irans destructive, and destabilizing behavior in the middle east and beyond. those days are over. iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. we will never let that happen. last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening american lives. at my direction, the united states military eliminated the worlds top terrorist, quasem soleimani. as the head of the quds force, soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities.    he trained terrorists armies, including hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets. he fueled bloody civil wars all across the region. he viciously wounded, and murdered thousands of us troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that may him and dismember their victims. soleimani directed the recent attacks on us personnel in iraq, that badly wounded for service members, and killed one american, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the us embassy in baghdad. in recent days, he was planning new attacks on american targets, but we stopped him.    soleimanis hands were drenched in both american and iranian blood. he should have been terminated long ago. by removing soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists. if you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people. as we continue to evaluate options in response to iranian aggression, the united states will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the iranian regime. these powerful sanctions will remain until iran changes its behavior. in recent months alone irans sea ships in international waters fired an unprovoked strike on saudi arabia, and shot down to us drones. irans hostilities substantially increased after the foolish iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. instead of saying thank you to the united states, they chanted death to america.    in fact, they chanted death to america the day the agreement was signed. then iran went on a terrorist spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in yemen, syria, lebanon, afghanistan, and iraq. the missiles fired last night at us, and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration. the regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country. even recently killing 1500 people, at the many protests that are taking place all throughout iran. the very defective jcpoa expires shortly anyway, and gives a ran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.    iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. the time has come for the united kingdom, germany, france, russia, and china to recognize this reality. they must now break away from the remnants of the iran deal, or jcpoa, and we must all work together toward making a deal with iran that makes the world a safer, and more peaceful place. we must also make a deal that allows iran to thrive and prosper and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential. iran can be a great country. peace and stability cannot prevail in the middle east as long as the iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred and war. the civilized world, must send a clear and unified message to the iranian regime. your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. it will not be allowed to go forward.    today, i am going to ask nato to become much more involved in the middle east process. over the last three years. under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before, and americas achieved energy independence. these historic accomplishments shades our strategic priorities. these are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible, and options in the middle east became available. we are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. we are independent and we do not need middle east oil. the american military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of two point $5 trillion. us armed forces are stronger than ever before.    our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast. under construction, are many hypersonic missiles. the fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. we do not want to use it. american strength, both military, and economic is the best deterrent. three months ago after destroying 100% of isis, and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of isis al-baghdadi who is responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of christians, muslims, and all who stood in his way. he was a monster. al-baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the isis caliphate and failed. tens of thousands of isis fighters have been killed or captured during my administration.    isis is a natural enemy of iran. the destruction of isis is good for iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities. finally, to the people and leaders of iran, we want you to have a future and a great future, one that you deserve. one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world. the united states is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. i want to thank you, and god bless america. thank you very much. thank you. thank you.  donald trump: (9:00) well, thank you very much and good afternoon. as president, my highest and most solemn duty is the defense of our nation and its citizens. last night, at my direction, the united states military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the number one terrorist anywhere in the world, qasem soleimani. soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on american diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him. under my leadership, americas policy is unambiguous to terrorists who harm or intend to harm any american. we will find you, we will eliminate you. we will always protect our diplomats, service members, all americans, and our allies.    for years, the islamic revolutionary guard corps and its ruthless quds force, under soleimanis leadership, has targeted, injured and murdered hundreds of american civilians and servicemen. the recent attacks on us targets in iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an american and injured four american servicemen very badly, as well as a violent assault on our embassy in baghdad, were carried out at the direction of soleimani.    soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as new delhi and london. today, we remember and honor the victims of soleimanis many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over. soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the middle east for the last 20 years. what the united states did yesterday should have been done long ago. a lot of lives would have been saved. just recently, soleimani led the brutal repression of protesters in iran, where more than a thousand innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government.    we took the action last night to stop a war. we did not take the action to start a war. i have deep respect for the iranian people. they are a remarkable people with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential. we do not seek regime change. however, the iranian regimes aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors must end and it must end now. the future belongs to the people of iran, those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation, not the terrorist warlords, who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad.    the united states has the best military by far anywhere in the world. we have the best intelligence in the world. if americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified, and i am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary, and that in particular refers to iran. under my leadership, we have destroyed the isis territorial caliphate, and recently american special operations forces killed the terrorist leader known as al-baghdadi. the world is a safer place without these monsters. america will always pursue the interests of good people, great people, great souls, while seeking peace, harmony, and friendship with all of the nations of the world. thank you. god bless you, god bless our great military, and god bless the united states of america. thank you very much. thank you.   thank you. thank you very much. thank you. today israel takes a big step towards peace. young people across the middle east are ready for a more hopeful future and governments through out the region are realizing that terrorism and islamic extremism are everyones common enemy. yesterday i had the pleasure of meeting with both the prime minister of israel and a man thats working very hard to become the prime minister of israel in the longest running election of all time, benny gantz of the blue and white party, and both leaders joined me to express their support for this effort, proving that the state of israel is looking for peace and that peace transcends politics by any measure. unmeasurable. thats what they want. on my first trip overseas as president, i visited the holy land of israel. i was deeply moved an amazed by what this small country had achieved in the face of overwhelming odds and never-ending threats. the state of israel comprises only a minuscule amount of land in the middle east, and yet it has become a thriving center of democracy and of ancient culture and commerce. israel is a light unto the world, the hearts and history of our people are woven together. the land of israel is an ancient home, a sacred place of worship, and a solemn promise to the jewish people that we will never again repeat historys darkest hour.    during my trip to israel, i also met with palestinian president abbas in bethlehem. i was saddened by the fate of the palestinian people. they deserve a far better life, they deserve the chance to achieve their extraordinary potential. palestinians have been trapped in a cycle of terrorism, poverty, and violence exploited by those seeking to use them as pawns to advance terrorism and extremism.    i returned from my visit determined to find a constructive path and its got to be a very powerful path forward in the israeli-palestinian conflict. to further this effort, i also met with president abbas at the white house. forging peace between israelis and palestinians may be the most difficult challenge of all. all prior administrations from president lyndon johnson have tried and bitterly failed, but i was not elected to do small things or shy away from big problems.    its been a long and very arduous process to arrive at this moment. on sunday i delivered to prime minister netanyahu my vision for peace, prosperity, and a brighter future for israelis and palestinians. this vision for peace is fundamentally different from past proposals. in the past, even the most well-intentioned plans were light on factual details and heavy on conceptual frameworks. by contrast, our plan is 80 pages and is the most detailed proposal ever put forward by far. as i have seen throughout my long career as a deal-maker, complex problems require nuanced, fact-based remedies. that is why our proposal provides precise technical solutions to make israelis, palestinians, and the region safer and much more prosperous. my vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides, a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of palestinian statehood to israels security.    today israel has taken a giant step toward peace. yesterday prime minister netanyahu informed me that he is willing to endorse the vision as the basis for direct negotiations, and i will say, the general also endorsed, and very strongly, with the palestinians a historic breakthrough. and likewise, we have really a situation having to do with a race that is taking place right now. it will end and we have the support, and its very important to say this, of both parties and almost all people in israel. they want peace and they want peace badly.    this is the first time israel has authorized the release of a conceptual map illustrating the territorial compromises its willing to make for the cause of peace and theyve gone a long way. this is an unprecedented and highly significant development. mr. prime minister, thank you for having the courage to take this bold step forward. we have a lot of powerful people in this room, a lot of the people that can help make it work. so thats quite a thunderous applause. thank you very much.    thank you. we will form a joint committee with israel to convert the conceptual map into a more detailed and calibrated rendering so that recognition can be immediately achieved. we will also work to create a contiguous territory within the future palestinian state, for when the conditions for statehood are met, including the firm rejection of terrorism.    under this vision, jerusalem will remain israels undivided, very important, undivided capital. but thats no big deal because ive already done that for you. weve already done that, but thats okay. its going to remain that way and the united states will recognize israeli sovereignty over the territory that my vision provides to be part of the state of israel, very important. and crucially, the proposed transition to a two-state solution will present no incremental security risk to the state of israel whatsoever. we will not allow a return to the days of bloodshed, bus bombings, nightclub attacks, and relentless terror. wont be allowed. peace requires compromise, but we will never ask israel to compromise its security. cant do that.    as everyone knows, i have done a lot for israel, moving the united states embassy to jerusalem, recognizing the golan heights, and frankly, perhaps most importantly, getting out of the terrible iran nuclear deal. there is a lot of spirit in this room. its true. you dont see it often. you dont see it often. therefore, it is only reasonable that i have to do a lot for the palestinians or it just wouldnt be fair. dont clap for that but its true. it wouldnt be fair. i want this deal to be a great deal for the palestinians. it has to be.    todays agreement is a historic opportunity for the palestinians to finally achieve an independent state of their very own. after 70 years of little progress, this could be the last opportunity they will ever have, and last for a lot of reasons. well never have a team like we have right now. we have a team of people that love the united states, and they love israel, and theyre very smart, and very, very committed, from your ambassador, david friedman to jason and avi and jared, and they are all great deal makers and they also understand the other side and they want the other side to do well, because thats the sign of a great deal and they understand that.    and i just appreciate all the hard work youve put in and so many of your other friends. and, of course, our great secretary of state, mike pompeo. oh, thats impressive. that was very impressive, mike. that reporter couldnt have done too good a job on you yesterday. i think you did a good job on her actually. thats good. thank you, mike. great, are you running for senate? i guess the answer is no after that. they all want him to. kansas, great state. they want him to, but youre doing a great job. dont move.    the palestinian people have grown distrustful after years of unfulfilled promises, so true, yet i know they are ready to escape their tragic past and realize a great destiny. but we must break free of yesterdays failed approaches. this map will more than double the palestinian territory and provide a palestinian capital in eastern jerusalem where america will proudly open an embassy. no palestinians or israelis will be uprooted from their homes. israel will work closely with a wonderful person, a wonderful man, the king of jordan, to ensure that the status quo of the temple mount is preserved and strong measures are taken to ensure that all muslims who wish to visit peacefully and pray at the al-aqsa mosque will be able to do so. this is a major statement. this is of major importance.    and at the same time, our vision will deliver a massive commercial investment of $50 billion into the new palestinian state. you have many, many countries that want to partake in this, and many of them are surrounding. they all want this to happen. virtually every one of them want this to happen. and i think, bibi, you know that very well. youre going to have tremendous support from your neighbors and beyond your neighbors.    over the next 10 years, if executed well, 1 million great new palestinian jobs will be created. their poverty rate will be cut in half. and their poverty rate is unacceptable now and only getting worse. their gdp will double and triple and much-needed hope, joy, opportunity, and prosperity will finally arrive for the palestinian people. our vision will end the cycle of palestinian dependency upon charity and foreign aid. they will be doing phenomenally all by themselves. they are a very, very capable people. and we will help by empowering the palestinians to thrive on their own. palestinians will be able to seize the new future with dignity, self-sufficiency, and national pride.    to ensure a successful palestinian state, we are asking the palestinians to meet the challenges of peaceful co-existence. this includes adopting basic laws enshrining human rights, protecting against financial...    laws, enshrining human rights. protecting against financial and political corruption, stopping the malign activities of hamas, islamic jihad and other enemies of peace. ending the incitement of hatred against israel, so important, and permanently halting the financial compensation to terrorists.    and perhaps most importantly, my vision gives the palestinians the time needed to rise up and meet the challenges of statehood. i sent a letter today to president abbas. i explained to him that the territory allocated for his new state will remain open and undeveloped for a period of four years.    during this time, palestinians can use all appropriate deliberation to study the deal, negotiate with israel, achieve the criteria for statehood, and become a truly independent and wonderful state. president abbas, i want you to know that if you choose the path to peace, america and many other countries we will be there. we will be there to help you in so many different ways and we will be there every step of the way. we will be there to help.    in other words, for the first time in many, many decades, i can say it will work. its going to work. if they do this, it will work. your response to this historic opportunity will show the world to what extent you are ready to lead the palestinian people to statehood. the middle east is changing rapidly. on my first trip aboard as president, i traveled to saudi arabia to discuss our shared priorities with the 54 leaders of the muslim and arab countries.    i made clear that all civilized nations share the same goals, stamping out extremism, creating opportunity for the regions youth, and we have to take care of the regions youth. the regions youth is growing up with no hope. we have to take care of the regions youth and existing in harmony with ones neighbors. since that time, immense progress has been made. a growing number of nations have taken strong stands against terrorism and radicalization. you see it. thanks to the courage of us forces the isis territorial caliphate, 100%; not 95% not 99, or any other percent, 100% of their caliphate, isis is destroyed. and its savage leader al-baghdadi is now dead.    and i want to thank, we have some our great senators and congressmen and women here and i want to thank you all for the tremendous help. thank you very much. jim. ted, everybody. stew. our leader, thank you. mark, thank you. great people. these are great people. they work so hard and they love this country.    the iranian regime is isolated and weakened greatly. we eliminated qasem soleimani the worlds top terrorist. and as you know, he was with the head of hezbollah. i dont think they were up to anything good. i dont think so. he ran an organization called jerusalem liberation forces and used his hatred, total severe hatred of israel as a rallying cry to divert attention from the incompetence and shortcomings of his government.    he falsely promoted the sinister notion that a free jerusalem, we must really be at war with israel. so to have it free, we have to be at war with israel and he said it very, very powerfully. in fact, its been in this false war that israel really the enemies of peace have used it. they just used it as an excuse to divide and totally oppress the middle east. in truth, jerusalem is liberated.    jerusalem is a safe, open, democratic city that welcomes people of all faiths and all places. it is time for the muslim world to fix the mistake it made in 1948 when it chose to attack instead of recognize the new state of israel. its time. since then, the amount of needless bloodshed and all squandered opportunities, so many squandered opportunities in the name of senseless causes is beyond measure. the palestinians have been the primary pawn in this regional adventurism and its time for this sad chapter in history to end, end quickly, end now. its never too late for courageous leaders to set a new course to pursue what is right, to change the future, only for the better.    america is prepared to work with all parties on our vision. so many other countries are willing, ready, and able to work with us. ive spoken to many of them. i cannot believe the amount of support this morning has. i cannot believe it. i have been called by leaders. boris called so many called and theyre all saying whatever we can do to help, they all want to see it happen.    but america cannot care more about peace than the stakeholders in the region. there are many muslims who never visited al-aqsa and many christians and jews who never visited the holy sites in the west bank described so vividly in the bible. my vision will change that. our majestic biblical heritage will be able to live, breathe, and flourish in modern times. all humanity should be able to enjoy the glories of the holy land. this part of the world is forever connected to the human soul and the human spirit. these ancient lands should not be symbols of conflict, but eternal symbols of peace.    thank you again for all of the work youve all done and all of these incredible honored guests for being here and in particular, i want to thank prime minister netanyahu. i also want to thank oman bahrain and the united arab emirates for the incredible work theyve done helping us with so much and sending their ambassadors to be with us today. thank you very much for being here.    yes [inaudible 00:24:33]. thank you very much. thank you very much. please give our regards. americas partnerships in the region have never been greater, and our alliance with the state of israel has never ever been stronger than it is today.    together we can bring about a new dawn in the middle east. and i would now, again, just like to thank everybody and a very special group of people, an incredible group of people. so many have been with us on this journey right from the beginning and were getting there. they say its the toughest deal ever to make in business when i have a tough deal, people would say this is tougher than the israelis and the palestinians. they used it as an excuse, meaning that was always the standard. actually, theres nothing tougher than this one, but we have to get it done. we have an obligation to humanity to get it done.    so i would now like to introduce the prime minister of israel whos worked so hard on this. benjamin netanyahu, thank you.    its a true privilege to be back in the great commonwealth of virginia. and, its a tremendous honor to stand on these historic grounds as the first president to address a joint session of the oldest lawmaking body in all of the western hemisphere, the virginia general assembly. congratulations.    on this day 400 years ago, here on the shores of the james river, the first representative legislative assembly in the new world convened. by the devotion of generations of patriots, it has flourished throughout the ages, and now that proud tradition continues with all of you.    to every virginian, and every legislator with us today, congratulations on four incredible centuries of history, heritage, and commitment to the righteous cause of american self-government. this is truly a momentous occasion.    i want to thank the governor of virginia for inviting me to speak at this very important event, and with us this morning, our many distinguished guests and officials from across the commonwealth, including lieutenant governor justin fairfax. thank you very much.    speaker, kirk cox. thank you, kirk. thank you. thank you, kirk.    senate majority leader, tommy norment. thank you. thank you. tommy. thank you.    and members of the host, and other federal, state, local and tribal leaders, all with us today. thank you very much.    were also very thankful as well to have with us secretary ben carson. ben, thank you very much. wherever you may be. thank you, ben.    and acting director, a person that you know very well, acting director ken cuccinelli. spent a lot of time with you, folks, and has a lot of respect for you.    and the terrific people at the department of the interior and the national park service. i want to thank you all for being here with us. its a great honor.    i also want to recognize everyone at american evolution and the jamestown settlement, the jamestown-yorktown foundation, the jamestown rediscovery project and preservation virginia. thank you very much. what a great job you do. thank you.    the fact is that each of you has helped protect and preserve our national treasures here at jamestown, and its a great debt. we owe you a great, great debt. thank you. what a job.    on this day in 1619, just a mile south of where we are gathered now, 22 newly elected members of the house of burgesses assembled in a small wooden church. they were adventurers and explorers, farmers and planters, soldiers, scholars, and clergyman.    all had struggled. all had suffered, and all had sacrificed in pursuit of one wild and very improbable dream. they called that dream, virginia.    it had been only 13 years since three small ships, the susan constant, the godspeed, and the discovery, set sail across the vast ocean. they carried 104 settlers to carve out a home on the edge of this uncharted continent.    they came from god and country. they came in search of opportunity and fortune, and they journeyed into the unknown with only meager supplies, long odds, and the power of their christian faith.    upon reaching cape henry at the mouth of the chesapeake bay, in 1607 a long time ago, the first men of the virginia company erected a cross upon the shore. they gave thanks to god and asked his blessing for their great undertaking. in the months and years ahead, they would dearly need it. the dangers were unparalleled.    the jamestown settlers arrived in america amid one of the worst droughts in over seven centuries. of 104 original colonists, 66 died by the years end. during the third winter, known as the starving time, a population of up to 500 settlers was reduced to 60.    by spring, those who remained were in search of whatever they could get to survive, and they were in dire trouble. they left jamestown deserted. they just sailed away, never to come back. but they had not gone far down the james river when they encountered the answer to their prayers, ships bearing a years worth of supplies, and more than 300 new settlers.    as we can see today on this great anniversary, it would not be the last time that god looked out for virginia. together, the settlers forged what would become the timeless traits of the american character. they worked hard. they had courage and abundance, and a wealth of self-reliance. they strived mightily to turn a profit. they experimented with producing silk, corn, tobacco, and the very first virginia wines.    at a prior settlement at roanoke, there had been no survivors, none at all. but where others had typically perished, the virginians were determined to succeed. they endured by the sweat of their labor, the aid of the powhatan indians, and the leadership of captain john smith.    as the years passed, ships bearing supplies and settlers from england also brought a culture and a way of life that would define the new world. it all began here.    in time, dozens of brave, strong women made the journey and joined the colony. and in 1618, the great charter and other reforms, established a system based on english common law.    for the first time, virginia allowed private land ownership. it created a basic judicial system. finally, it gave the colonists a say in their own future, the right to elect representatives by popular vote.    with us today in tribute to that english legal inheritance is the former clerk of the british house of commons, sir david natzler. thank you, david. thank you. sir david, we are thrilled to have you with us. thank you very much for being here. thank you very much, david.    at that first american assembly in 1619, the weather was so hot that one legislator actually died. mercifully, the session was cut very short. but before adjourning, the assembly passed laws on taxation, agriculture, and trade with the indians.    with true american optimism, the assembly even endorsed a plan to build a world class university, in this still-rugged wilderness. it was a vision that would one day be fulfilled just miles from here, at one of americas earliest educational institutions, the esteemed college of william and mary. great place. great place.    as we mark the first representative legislature at jamestown, our nation also reflects upon an anniversary from that same summer, four centuries ago. in august, 1619, the first enslaved africans in the english colonies arrived in virginia. it was the beginning of a barbaric trade in human lives. today in honor, we remember every sacred soul who suffered the horrors of slavery and the anguish of bondage.    more than 150 years later, at americas founding, our declaration of independence recognized the immortal truth that all men are created equal. yet, it would ultimately take a civil war, 85 years after that document was signed, to abolish the evil of slavery.    it would take more than another century for our nation, in the words of reverend martin luther king, jr., to live out the true meaning of its creed, and extend the blessings of freedom to all americans.    in the face of grave oppression and grave injustice, african americans have built, strengthened, inspired, uplifted, protected, defended, and sustained our nation from its very earliest days.    last year, i was privileged to sign the law establishing a commission to commemorate the arrival of the first africans to the english colonies, and the 400 years of african american history that have followed.    that was an incredible day. that was an incredible event. today, we are grateful to be joined by that commissions chairman, dr. joseph green. thank you, dr. green, please. thank you. thank you very much. dr. green.    in the decades that followed that first legislative assembly, the democratic tradition established here lay deep roots all across virginia. it spread up and down the atlantic coast.    one fact was quickly established for all time. in america, we are not ruled from afar. americans govern ourselves, and so help us, god, we always will.    right here in virginia, your predecessors-    thank you very much, thank you.    right here in virginia, your predecessors came to williamsburg from places you all know very well. they were named such as george washington, from fairfax county. thomas jefferson, from albemarle county. james madison, from orange county. james monroe, from spotsylvania county. patrick henry, from louisa county. george mason, from fairfax county. george with, w-i-t-h, thats a great name, from williamsburg. and richard henry lee, from westmoreland county. incredible names, incredible names.    self government in virginia did not just give us a state we love. in a very true sense, it gave us the country we love, the united states of america. so true. thank you very much.    when madison drafted the first amendment to our constitution, he drew inspiration from virginias statute for religious freedom. as john adams wrote in philadelphia, just before the adoption of the declaration of independence, we all look up to virginia for examples. great. its so great.    and when patrick henry rose to speak his famous words at st. johns church in richmond, give me liberty or give me death, he spoke in defense of a tradition that began more than 150 years before at jamestown. right here.    it was a heritage those patriots would fight a long war of independence to defend, and it is a heritage that countless americans have fought and died for to secure in all of those centuries since. in our time, we must vigorously defend those cherished democratic traditions that have made our beloved republic the envy of the entire world. and it still is, as much as ever before, and maybe more.    our hard-won culture of self-government must be nourished, protected, and constantly preserved. that is why we must speak out strongly against anyone who would take power away from citizens, individuals, and state governments such as yours. in america, the people will forever rule. the people will forever reign, and the people will forever be sovereign.    from the first legislative assembly down to today, america has been the story of citizens who take ownership of their future and their control of their destiny. that is what self-rule is all about, everyday americans coming together to take action, to build, to create, to seize opportunities, to pursue the common good, and to never stop striving for greatness.    four centuries ago, one early voyager to jamestown captured the spirit of confidence and daring that has always powered our great experiment in self-government. he wrote, we hope to plant a nation where none before hath stood. that was something.    in that hope, the men and women of jamestown achieved success beyond anything they could possibly have imagined. they started the nation that settled the wilderness, won our independence, tamed the wild west, ended slavery, secured civil rights, invented the airplane, vanquished the nazis, brought communism to its knees, and placed our great american flag on the face of the moon.    and in a program thats just started, someday very soon, american astronauts will plant our beautiful stars and stripes on the surface of mars.    but among all of americas towering achievements, none exceeds the triumph that we are here to celebrate today. our nations priceless culture of freedom, independence, equality, justice, and self-determination under god.    that culture is the source of who we are. it is our prized inheritance. it is our proudest legacy. it is among the greatest human accomplishments in the history of the world. what you have done is the greatest accomplishment in the history of the world, and i congratulate you. it started right here.    now, we must go bravely into the future, just as those bold explorers first ventured into this majestic land. we must call upon the same scale of imagination, the same thirst for knowledge, the same love of adventure, the same unrelenting courage, and the same total determination to prevail.    above all, we must be proud of our heritage, united in our purpose, and filled with confidence in our shared great, great, great american destiny.    for in america, no challenge is too great. no journey is too tough. no task is too large. no dream is beyond our reach. when we set our sight on the summit, nothing can stand in our way. america always gets the job done. america always wins.    that is why after 400 years of glorious american democracy, we have returned here to this place to declare to all the world that the united states of america and the great commonwealth of virginia are just getting started.    our future is bigger, bolder, better, and brighter than ever before. its been a great honor for me to be with you this morning. id like to thank you. god bless you. god bless virginia, and god bless america. thank you very much everybody. thank you.   thank you very much and thank you to the original lee greenwood. thank you. thank you, lee. great guy. well, i just want to say a very big hello, kentucky? great place. its great to be here in the home of a group called the wildcats. you ever hear the kentucky wildcats? by the way, they play at a very big arena. this place. look at this. hello, up there? this is incredible. with thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving american patriots, which is what you are. what you are.    tomorrow, the people of kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific republican governor, matt bevin. hes done a fantastic job. hes done a fantastic job. and were sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. but you see whats happening with the democrats, they have gone crazy. the do nothing democrats, and theyre not getting it done. under republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and america is stronger than ever before. true.    kentuckys unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. thats not bad. and i want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that matt bevin has done as governor, hes had to do some things that you had to do. and hes done unbelievably well. it sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. you had to do it. so i just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. you have the best numbers youve ever had in the history of the state. and with the help of your senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. were supporting our police, were rebuilding our military, were defeating radical islamic terrorists like never before. the monsters animal known as al-baghdadi is dead. and the man that took his place is dead also. american special forces gave the worlds number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. no enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the united states military, which is now stronger than ever before. weve rebuilt it and it was all made in america. all made in america. and our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again.    but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. they want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. you better be careful. the second amendment very, very important, very precious. they are after your second amendment. with us, nobodys touching our second amendment. and that includes the gentleman thats running against matt. theyre after your second amendment. we cant let that happen. they want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional america american values. all you have to do is ask the boys from covington catholic high school. some of whom are here tonight.    the far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. they want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. they want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but kentucky will never be broken. kentucky cant be broken. youre too strong and youre too smart. in their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. first, democrats engineer the russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the american people, the russian hoax. then they did the mueller scam. you remember that? the mueller scam. two years and they said nothing. and then mr. mueller testified. that was a wonderful day for me.    you remember last week. i dont know tulsi gabbard, but hillary clinton said that tulsi gabbard is a russian agent. i dont know jill stein. shes a greenie and thats fine. shes a greenie, jill stein. but jill stein was an agent of russia also. these people are crazy. now corrupt politicians, nancy pelosi and adam schiff, they are corrupt. and nancy, unlike kentucky, which is doing great, nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in san francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. whats happened is san francisco and whats happened to so many other places run by the radical left democrats, its unbelievable.    los angeles. you take a look at los angeles, looks like a third world city. but go back to nancys area, look at whats happened. theres been no place in the country thats gone down like the area that nancy pelosi represents. and shes wasting all of her time. and you know what, its backfiring. you see it. but the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. impeachment. think of it. so today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. now, thats hundreds of days.    so last week, think of this, in the history of our country, its never done better. and by the way, thats not rich, thats not poor, thats for everybody. your 401(k)s, how you are doing? pretty good, right? pretty good. people tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, theyve been running the 401(k)s for years. and they totally lost respect for lets say, the husband, totally lost respect. now they think hes a financial genius because hes up 74%. she says, darling, i love you. you are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. and you know what, if the democrats get in, thats not going down by 50%, thats going down to nothing. its going to be worthless. its going to be worthless.    youll have a depression the likes of which youve never seen. mark my words. but hopefully, we dont have to even think about it. and that was going to happen here. when we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. and dont forget, that was zero interest. were paying interest. in other words, people are now getting interest in their money. but that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of americans. to be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the house of representatives.    theyve been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. and actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. before we won. 19 minutes after i took the oath of office, that disgusting washington post, look at all these people back there, look. fake news media. its the fake news. look at all of them. what they dont know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if i still have the strength, 21 years. see, now theyre going crazy. now theyre saying, see, i told you, he was a dictator. he wants to take charge in control of our country. these people are crazy.    you have one nut job on television. hes sitting down doing an interview recently. and he looks at the person hes interviewing and he goes like hes in total depression. total depression. and he goes ... good fans up there. thank you. he goes, you know hes going to win, dont you? you know, hes going to win. like [devon 00:13:41] said. the guy goes, well, were going to fight and were going to ... no, no. hes going to win. you know hes never leaving office, dont you? hes never going to leave office. these people are crazy. theyre crazy.    but that disgusting newspaper thats right there, the washington post, declared the campaign to impeach president trump has just begun. all right, you can get them out. be gentle, be gentle. be very gentle. you know every time i say, get them out of here, i end up getting sued. they say, he hurt my arm. all right. so be very gentle, please. i dont want to get sued. be very gentle. very, very gentle. hes going home to mom. thank you. by the way, do we love our law enforcement? and in the whole world, even on a monday night, i like the monday nights because i think were 58 and 0, thats a good record. even for the wildcats, thats a good. were 58 and 0, but even on a monday night, is there anything cooler than being at a trump rally? nothing can. with last weeks vote, the far left has declared war on american democracy itself. these people are lunatics. in the face of these attacks, republicans are the most unified that ive ever seen, and ive been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. and the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know theyre not going to win in 2020. so lets see what can we do to win, but thats not working too well. youll see. the american people are fed up with democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. the democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. tomorrow, kentucky has a chance to send the radical democrats a message. you will vote to reject democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect kentucky governor matt bevin whos done a great job. matts a veteran. hes a patriot. hes done it all. hes been a very, very successful business leader. he put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job hes done is incredible. under his leadership, kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but i helped also. we work together. now, he is difficult. i have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but its okay.    look, hes such a pain, when he needs something for kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into kentucky. could you call the head of some company in japan, please? i say, matt, do i have to do it? please, please. but isnt that really what you wanted in a governor? thats what you want. hes such a pain in the ass, but thats what you want. and the job hes done, one of the best in the country. not the best. hes been incredible. matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. thank you. hes pro-worker, pro-life and 100% pro-second amendment.    by the way, youre going to lose your second amendment if you vote in democrats. you think im kidding? i see what theyre saying. i watch what theyre doing. theyre calling me all the time. you will lose your second amendment as soon ... im telling you. as sure as youre standing here, is anybody sitting? nobody ever sits. you can sit if you want. no, just stand. you know what they say in the fake news? look, youve been standing. nobody sat? i dont know. isnt that exciting? nobody sat. you know what they say? no, you know what they say? they say, trump only got one standing ovation. because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they dont say the second part. its great. great spirit.    you know why? you love our country. and you see whats happening. we have turned this big monster ship. we have turned it around. and we need so badly. you know, its like you plant a tree. it takes a lot. we have to get those roots to hold. we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. so many things. the best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. and i think im going to count but i think its like 118. i told you, we have a record stock market today. i think about 100 ... im going to have to check it. because you know with the fake news, if im off by half a point. if its 117 and not 118, even if i go under, they report it. they say, he didnt tell the truth. it was really 119. but like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. think of that. thats incredible.    but matt bevin has made record investments in education spending for kentucky students. education is so important to him. matt bevin will defend your kentucky values. he loves his state. from an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. not good. i cant even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? this guy, beshear, is a major lefty. you know that, right? why are we even ... lets just have a good time. are you sure we need an election tomorrow, matt? i dont know. how does kentucky vote for a person ... im telling you, he will always vote for pelosi and schumer and shifty schiff.    how about this guy? how about schiff. he makes up a conversation. he gets up before the united states congress. he repeats my conversation with the head of the ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. i said, i never said that. he made a horrible statement. it was a total lie. and then i actually wanted to release the actual conversation. and you havent heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, youre going to find out. but these are very dishonest people, shifty schiff. but matts running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because theyre dangerous.    the radical left named andy beshear, who rejects everything kentucky stands for. thats who they want to win. beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of donald trump. what are the policies? take care of our vets, take care of our military. we want jobs. we want companies to stop leaving us. theyre not leaving anymore. you see, companies arent leaving anymore. have you noticed? remember years ago before i ever thought of doing this? i mean, when i said lets do this, i said to our great now first lady. i said, melania, lets give it a shot. and then, one by one, we were doing good.    and what weve done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into mexico. they were going to china, japan. they were going all over. any place but kentucky. you dont read about that at all. now theyre all coming back. theyre all coming back. but beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of kentucky. the greatest economy youve ever had, hes going to destroy it. and it wont be long. itll go very quickly. you know, youre all sitting there. everybody has good jobs. you dont like it, you go find another job. its like the choice i got from military.    i got you choice too. if you dont like your job, you find another one. you tell the boss, i am getting out of here, i dont like this guy. you go get a better job for more money. beshear doesnt represent you. he represents the washington swamp and hes backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. beshear supported crooked hillary clinton, and hes funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. open borders, let everyone pour right in. let them all pour right in. beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to kentucky, think of that one. releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent kentucky families. he wants sanctuary cities. he hasnt learned whats happened.    we had a great election a couple of weeks ago in north carolina. we won two house seats. we were supposed to lose, probably both of them. we won them by a lot. we won them by a lot. and i think we won them because of the second amendment, because its under assault from democrats. but i think we won also because of sanctuary cities. because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. and i think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of kentucky. tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, republican. we got to go republican all the way. i want to bring up a man, and im serious about this. this guy works so hard. hes a great natural talent in business, which you needed. and he straightened it out. and ill tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. matt bevin, come on up matt.    so were also joined tonight by a very powerful man in washington, your great senator mitch mcconnell. nobody works harder for kentucky than mitch. i will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. its up here. i know a lot of people that work hard. he works smart. when the democrat arsonists in washington tried to destroy an innocent man named brett kavanaugh, now justice brett kavanaugh, mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. and thats what it was, it was a mob. there has never been a man treated so badly in washington as judge kavanaugh, previously judge, now justice. we got him in, and hes been great, and he will be great.    mitch confirmed two tremendous supreme court justices. mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass va choice and va accountability for our amazing veterans. now, i know mitchs opponent because they came here. do you remember last year? slightly different location, and thats okay, it was still the great state of kentucky. because andy barr had amy mcgrath, an extreme liberal against him. andy barr is here with us tonight, and were going to introduce him, but he beat her. so she said to herself, well, you know, i failed in congress, now lets go for the senate. she wanted to go to the house, now she wants to go. its not going to work that way. extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things.    amy mcgrath compared my election, think of this one ... its so insulting. i shouldnt say it. should i say it? yeah, why not. no, its so insulting. you know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. she compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation.    she wants open borders. she supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. she wants to get rid of it. she wasnt too happy with me last year. we came in, andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. she was caught telling donors, democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the state of kentucky. is that what you want? its not what you want. so next november, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed kentucky conservative, mitch mcconnell. but were going to get back to that later. well be back many times. well be back here many times. mitch. where is he?    so president obama left mitch, and me, and rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. youre not supposed to allow any. you dont do that. you know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? including the supreme court, obviously. i came in and i said, how many do we have? they said, how many what, sir? i said, judge openings. and i thought theyd say none, or one or two. he said, sir, we have 142. i said, what? i said, tell me again. he said, we have 142. so mitch and i and rand would like to thank very much president obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and hes really become a good friend of mine. and ill tell you, hes a little bit different. its okay. but whenever ive needed him, whenever i needed him, he was always there. its true. i mean, sometimes like id say,  i dont need you to vote, rand. good. and hell vote his own way. hes got that little libertarian touch. thats okay. thats okay. but whenever we need, and im not talking about me, im talking about we, we need a vote, hes so incredible\""
